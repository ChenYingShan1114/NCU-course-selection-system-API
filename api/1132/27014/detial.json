These include using Python to analyze brain data, latest conventions and practices in the field, latest advanced approaches in the field such as functional connectivity, data-mining, modeling, etc. This will be a good platform for those in data analytics interested in working with cognitive neuroscience data, and those in cognitive neurosciences seeking to learn data analytic tools.\nThe course will be conducted in conjunction with BrainHack School (https://school.brainhackmtl.org/). We will use a format that combines self-study via online modules and Teaching Assistant (TA) advising. TAs will be from local (Taiwan) as well as international locations (as listed in the BrainHack School website), who come with various interdisciplinary perspectives. Course students will explore relevant topics in interaction with TAs from various backgrounds in order to conduct a practical project.\nStudent project topics will be determined jointly with the TAs who will provide advice on what are feasible/meaningful goals. We are highly flexible on project topics as long as they are geared to either let students learn new techniques or to complete a real scientific research analysis of extant data within the course time frame. Students will need to submit a project report in the form of a webpage and a recorded video presentation, which will be the basis of the course grade.\nFrom 20th Feb 2023 to 7th May 2023, students will self-study the online modules. TAs will be available for Q/A regarding the module content and project discussions mostly locally. The time schedule will be flexible and self-paced as TAs and students are available.\nBetween 8th May 2023 to 4th June 2023, this course will join the BrainHack School schedule via Discord. This will still have flexible schedule, but with more structured weekly goals (see Progress below) and interactions. During this period, we expect students and TAs to engage with each other about modules and projects at least approximately 3 hrs every other day. International TAs will also more available pending time-difference allowances. The last week will be for formal submisions of project webpages and presentations.\nWe are in the midst of coordinating TA, module, website details. The above BrainHack School url is from previous years as an example. This NTU COOL syllabus will be regularly updated as more information becomes available. Be sure to check in every few days. We will conduct a course orientation sometime during the first week of the semester between 20 (MON) - 24 (FRI) Feb 2023. The exact time/date/format will be detailed closer to semester start.
