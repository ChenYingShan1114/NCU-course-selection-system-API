The Renaissance period in which he lived was, on the one hand, breaking away from the chaos, conquest, barbarism and depression of the Dark Middle Ages; on the other hand, it was about to create a new era. This divisive turn made the spirit of this period full of liberating freedom, the courage to take risks, and the courage to try. From Bosch, Botticelli to Da Vinci, we can see the different styles of artistic innovation and the inheritance of difference. In terms of humanistic thought, Montaigne‘s The Essays also shows that people at this time were curious about everything, eager to express their opinions on everything, and full of various observations and insights, which also established the core meaning of the word “essay“ : An innovative attempt at thinking.\nThe Essays has a total of 107 short essays, covering daily life, custom analysis and life reflection, and is published in three volumes. This semester focuses on the discussion of “Volume 1“. The course is divided into two stages. The first stage is to understand Montaigne’s thoughts through text reading. The second stage explores the relationship between Montaigne’s thoughts and contemporary social phenomena, and the inspiration for shaping personal personality.\nWeek 01: Introduction.\nWeek 02: On sadness or pretense.\nWeek 03: On Passion.\nWeek 04: On boredom or emptying out.\nWeek 05: On lying or creation.\nWeek 06: On predictions or expectations.\nWeek 07: On hospitality.\nWeek 08: On friendship.\nWeek 09: On judgment or bias.\nWeek 10: On imagination or hallucination.\nWeek 11: On habits or mechanism.\nWeek 12: On difference or discrimination.\nWeek 13: Useless or useful.\nWeek 14: On luxury production or frugal sustainability.\nWeek 15: On Death and Philosophy.\nWeek 16: In terms of age.\nWeek 17: Final paper writing (independent research).\nWeek 18: Final paper writing (independent research)."}, "textbook": {"ch": "蒙田（2019），《蒙田隨筆》，馬振騁譯。台北：五南，卷一至卷三。\n阮慶岳（2020），《散步去蒙田》。台北：九歌。", "en": "Montaigne(2011).The Complete Essays, trans.
