Each\nweek, two short articles are chosen from Japanese popular science\nmagazines. A-half-page or one-page articles about recent news in\nthe field of natural science are used for this part. The\ninstructor (Kinoshita Daisuke) read those articles without\npassing these articles to students. Students listen to those\narticles, and talk about what they understand. After the\ndiscussion, articles are provided to students, so that they can\ncheck whether they successfully grab the overall meaning of the\narticles.\nPart B:\nNext 80 min is used for reading of longer articles. Each week,\none article is chosen from Japanese popular science\nmagazines. Two-page or four-page articles about natural science are\nused for this part. An article is passed to students at the\nbeginning of this part. The instructor (Kinoshita Daisuke) read\nabout 70％ of the article. Then, students and I discuss about\ncontent of the article. Students can also ask questions about\nmeaning of words, grammar, and article content.
