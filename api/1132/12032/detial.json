In this course, we will focus on primarily Anglophone and Chinese feminist literatures – fiction and non-fiction – from this arena that address questions arising in the local(s) and trans-locally. The course will trace three moments through textual events. The first unit introduces third world feminist narratives of women’s movement alongside a controversial debate on third world literature and its address. The second unit contrasts the temporally adjacent writings of communist feminist Aleksandra Kollontai in the nascent Soviet Union, anarchist feminist He Zhen in revolutionary China, and socialist feminist Charlotte Perkins Gilman in early twentieth century USA. The third unit examines US second wave feminist debates around sexuality, class, race and capitalist patriarchy in post/cold war USA and how the latter come to overshadow USA protégé Taiwan, from the nineteen seventies (USA) through the nineteen nineties (Taiwan), polarizing activism and thought on and around sexual work and services, sexual politics, gender and transgender politics, obfuscating the “slow [trickle down] violence” of family, nation, and war. The last unit comprises two sets of readings, the first focuses on the question of a domestic femininity in continued crisis, throwing up the shadow of a capitalist-confucian patriarchy’s imbrication with uterine or mother power. The second set comprises four articles from a recent special issue examining “mediations” and its remainders, with essays on Inter-Asia negative transference through the writings of Tagore and Qu Qiubai, translating sex in early twentieth century Chinese, tensions between yao sex work and transgender politics in China, and feminist conundrums of family, marriage, and nation in Taiwan. The final unit’s two sets of essays can be read as oblique, critical responses to unit one and three’s left and feminist theorizing of literature and women’s movements narratives.\nFor those interested in taking the class, please pre-read three of the following novels in English or Chinese translation(s): 1) Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Herland (1915), 2) Rabindranath Tagore, The Home and the World (1916), 3) Leslie Feinberg, Stone Butch Blues (1993), 4) Cho Nam-Joo, Kim Jiyoung, born 1982 (2016). All four will be available at Gaoguan by August 24, 2021. We will discuss and write in response to a question on each one of these texts the first day of class.\nClosely read and engage with as you describe, summarize, and analyze different texts, toward a working paper that synthesizes select materials from the course in a final paper. The latter can take a fictional form, or an academic one; please discuss this with the instructor before writing. The course will also require a minimum of nine weekly reading journals due two days (Mon midnight) before class (30％), one or two individual or partnered presentation depending on participant numbers (20％), and a final paper (50％).", "en": "Course Description\nInter-Asia refers to a cultural studies journal while also meaning an intellectual movement among and between peoples living in and moving across “Asia” – a geographic and political imaginary construed through Anglophone imperial knowledge and semi-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial administrations in various competing forms of nation-statehood.
