Therefore, how to facilitate learning in authentic contexts and help learners reflect on the kind of activities they do in the real world becomes very crucial. Therefore, In the course, GAI-powered authentic contextual learning is vital and relevant to learners’ learning process. In this course, we will focus on digital learning in authentic contexts using advanced technology like GAI and recognition to facilitate students to develop high-level cognition like creativity with sustainability.  \nCreativity is the use of knowledge, imagination, and judgment by students to solve problems in an innovative, high quality, and appropriate manner. Clarke, Dede, Ketelhut, and Nelson (2006) defined sustainability to refer to an ability to learn programs to remain in use and scalability as an ability to learning programs and design to be adapted in a wide variety of contexts. \nTherefore, helping learners achieve the above abilities in digital learning design using GAI becomes critical to success in education. This is because learning in an authentic context with the help of advanced technologies like GAI can potentially realize the above abilities and complement traditional learning in class/at school. \nClarke, J., Dede, C., Ketelhut, D.
