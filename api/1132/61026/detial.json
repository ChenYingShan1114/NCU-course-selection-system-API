Lectures and discussions are intended to facilitate proper understanding and use of the data products including the theoretical basis underlying the creation of the products. This course ends with a hands-on air quality event case study to provide an opportunity to review the materials presented during the course and illustrate how to conceptually analyze an event. Throughout the course, students will be assigned four homeworks and given a topic to write a term paper based on their specific interests. The course will help graduate students confidently learn how to use remote sensing data in their research."}, "textbook": {"ch": "(a) The NASA Applied Remote SEnsing Training (ARSET) air quality project (http://airquality.gsfc.nasa.gov/)\n(b) R.
