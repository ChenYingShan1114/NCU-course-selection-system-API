Spaces of injustice where \npractical and theoretical knowledge is produced, \ndisseminated, and assessed are not rare. \nThis course seeks to provide students with \nphilosophical tools to reflect on such \nspaces. To do so, we will examine two forms of \nepistemic injustice: testimonial and hermeneutical, both \nintroduced by British philosopher Miranda Fricker in her \n2007 monograph Epistemic Injustice: Power and the \nEthics of Knowing. \nWe will pay attention to what is characteristic of \nthem, cases illustrating them, and references preceding \nand following M.
