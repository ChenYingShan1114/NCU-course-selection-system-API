Conceptually, queer theorists challenged the essentialism espoused by many feminists in the 80s.

In this seminar, we‘ll try to cover those key founding texts by major queer theorists. We‘ll address important issues and controversies at their nascent stage, such as the question of essentialism, male homosocial desire, the construction of the closet, and gender performativity.
