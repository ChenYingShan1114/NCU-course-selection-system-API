Each week students will be asked to write a short analysis of the structure and argumentation of a sample paper according to its use of one or more of the techniques introduced in the textbooks. Students will be assigned to go over the readings in class, leading a class discussion in which other students will actively participate.\nDuring the second part of the course, our meetings will be conducted as workshop seminars also led by the students. Each week, students will lead discussions of one or two papers for this purpose and lead at least one discussion of a classmate’s paper. The papers will be distributed one week ahead of time so that the other students can prepare their written feedback in advance. Although there will be designated discussion leaders, all students will be expected to prepare brief written feedback for each paper and participate in the discussions. These workshop discussions will be based on writing techniques covered in the first part of the semester. The final paper will be a revision of the workshop paper in response to the material covered in this course and feedback received during the workshop. Critique will be rigorous but also very constructive (with emphasis on the latter), and students are expected to substantially rewrite their papers (not simply add a paragraph or two, but conduct further research, rethink and rewrite). In addition, each student will write an annotated bibliography to include five entries on articles or book chapters in their field of research. These secondary sources will be incorporated into students’ final, rewritten papers.", "en": "The first assignments are textbook readings on structure and research methodology for academic essays in humanities, and we will discuss these assignments by analyzing sample student papers.
