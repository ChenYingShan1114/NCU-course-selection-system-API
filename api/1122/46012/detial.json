With global temperature showing an undisputable rising trend, a huge volume of ice and glaciers has melted, raising the sea level high enough to cause flooding in coastal cities. For some island countries, the government must seek home for some of their citizens at a higher place or in a different country. And Indonesia is even being forced to move its capital to another city. Climate change has also affected water supply and crop cultivation quite significantly for some regions. And the current animal/plant extinction rate is just unprecedented in the entire history of the Earth.\n    To turn the tide against the increasingly severe climate change and global warming, virtually all countries have acted by making various efforts to regulate their economic activities, from raw material excavation to production, logistics, warehousing, and finally, recycling. Firms have started to pay great attentions to their energy consumption and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. A number of policies, regulations, acts, and agreements, including ErP, RoHS, REACH, WEEE, and the Paris Agreement, were made and enforced to hopefully strike a good balance between the triple bottom line: economy, environment, and society. Obviously, sustainability has been the world’s most important development policy!\n    Human civilization cannot thrive without a stable energy supply. To limit the rise of global average temperature to 2.0°C at most (and to 1.5°C if possible) before the end of this century, we must replace the consumption of all fossil fuels with renewable energy in the next few decades. The ultimate goal is to emit no greenhouse gases ASAP. However, renewables such as solar and wind cannot provide a stable energy supply. Moreover, the type of electricity that they generate is direct current and often, such energy is produced in small volumes across a very big area. How to make efficient use of these renewables thus present a major challenge even to those leading countries."}, "outline": {"ch": "本課程將聚焦下列議題，以引領修課同學進入再生能源與永續發展領域。\n1. 氣候變遷與全球暖化\n2. 永續發展與企業社會責任\n3. 再生能源與儲能科技\n4. 太陽能與風能\n5. 再生能源規劃\n6. 電動車與運輸電氣化", "en": "The following outlines the topics to be covered in this course:\n1. climate change and global warming\n2. sustainability and corporate social responsibility\n3. renewable energy and energy storage technology\n4. solar and wind energy\n5. renewable energy planning\n6. electric vehicles and the electrification of road transport"}, "textbook": {"ch": "由任課教師編輯授課內容", "en": "All teaching materials are edited by the instructor."}, "selfCompiledRate": {"ch": "100", "en": "100"}, "instructMethod": {"ch": "講授\n\n\n個別指導\n其他", "en": ["Lecture", "", "", "Individual Instruction", "Others"]}, "gradMethod": {"ch": "學期專題；兩次報告 (各 50％)", "en": "semester team project with two presentations (50％ E.A.)"}, "officeHour": {"ch": "週四下午 2:00~4:00 (管二館 733-1)", "en": "Thursday afternoon 2:00~4:00 (The 2nd Building of SoM; room 733-1)"}, "teachWeeks": {"ch": "18", "en": "18"}, "flexDiscription": {"ch": "", "en": ""}, "domain": {"ch": "研究方法\n\n\n、\n\n\n規劃與控制", "en": "研究方法\n\n\n、\n\n\n規劃與控制"}, "map": {"ch": [{"competencies": "原創性", "rating": "(4)高", "assesments": ["口頭報告/口試", "專題研究報告(書面)"]}, {"competencies": "熟悉其專業領域文獻", "rating": "(4)高", "assesments": ["口頭報告/口試", "專題研究報告(書面)"]}, {"competencies": "獨立思考和解決問題能力", "rating": "(4)高", "assesments": ["口頭報告/口試", "專題研究報告(書面)"]}, {"competencies": "溝通能力", "rating": "(2)低", "assesments": ["口頭報告/口試", "專題研究報告(書面)"]}], "en": [{"competencies": "Original Contribution", "rating": "(4)High", "assesments": ["Presentation/Oral Exam", "Research Report(printed on paper)"]}, {"competencies": "Proficiency with Discipline-related Literature", "rating": "(4)High", "assesments": ["Presentation/Oral Exam", "Research Report(printed on paper)"]}, {"competencies": "Critical Thinking and Problem-solving", "rating": "(4)High", "assesments": ["Presentation/Oral Exam", "Research Report(printed on paper)"]}, {"competencies": "Communication Skill", "rating": "(2)Low", "assesments": ["Presentation/Oral Exam", "Research Report(printed on paper)"]}]}, "assignCriteria": {"ch": ["學制:限碩士班、博士班。"], "en": ["Type:Master's Program、Doctoral Program only."]}, "preselecStu": 0, "stuGender": {"male": 6, "Female": 3}, "stuGrade": {"doctor": {}, "master": {"1": 7, "2": 1}, "bachelor": {"4": 1}}, "stus": [{"serial": "1", "stunum": "11*******", "department": "機械工程學系光機電工程組", "grade": "4", "class": "1", "priority": "1", "isRequired": false, "isPreselected": false, "isManuallySelected": false, "isCodeSelected": true}, {"serial": "2", "stunum": "11*******", "department": "工業管理研究所碩士班", "grade": "1", "class": "*", "priority": "1", "isRequired": false, "isPreselected": false, "isManuallySelected": false, "isCodeSelected": true}, {"serial": "3", "stunum": "11*******", "department": "工業管理研究所碩士班", "grade": "1", "class": "*", "priority": "1", "isRequired": false, "isPreselected": false, "isManuallySelected": false, "isCodeSelected": true}, {"serial": "4", "stunum": "11*******", "department": "工業管理研究所碩士班", "grade": "1", "class": "*", "priority": "1", "isRequired": false, "isPreselected": false, "isManuallySelected": false, "isCodeSelected": true}, {"serial": "5", "stunum": "11*******", "department": "工業管理研究所碩士班", "grade": "1", "class": "*", "priority": "1", "isRequired": false, "isPreselected": false, "isManuallySelected": false, "isCodeSelected": true}, {"serial": "6", "stunum": "11*******", "department": "工業管理研究所碩士班", "grade": "1", "class": "*", "priority": "1", "isRequired": false, "isPreselected": false, "isManuallySelected": false, "isCodeSelected": true}, {"serial": "7", "stunum": "11*******", "department": "工業管理研究所碩士班", "grade": "1", "class": "*", "priority": "1", "isRequired": false, "isPreselected": false, "isManuallySelected": false, "isCodeSelected": true}, {"serial": "8", "stunum": "11*******", "department": "工業管理研究所碩士班", "grade": "1", "class": "*", "priority": "1", "isRequired": false, "isPreselected": false, "isManuallySelected": false, "isCodeSelected": true}, {"serial": "9", "stunum": "11*******", "department": "工業管理研究所碩士班", "grade": "2", "class": "*", "priority": "1", "isRequired": false, "isPreselected": false, "isManuallySelected": false, "isCodeSelected": true}]}
