We will have a project in a group of Three students. Each group needs to choose and work on a specific subject. One presentation and one final report must be submitted for the group.\nClass Participation. Class participation is crucial for learning the course content and for keeping in pace with the class progress.\n1) You should be prepared for each class and should try to contribute to class discussions. Active and cooperative learning will be encouraged. During the lecture, you are expected to answer/raise questions, and participate in small-group activities such as modeling and solving problems, and interpreting solutions.\n2) Attendance will be taken in classes and will constitute part of your participation grade.\nAssignments.  You will apply the concepts learnt in class to a variety of problems. The assignments will be given to students in the end of each topic. Homework assignments must be prepared in a group of Two students.\n1) All assignments should be prepared professionally. Every assignment must include your name and student ID number. Unorganized, illegible, or incomplete assignments will not be graded.\n2) Late assignments will not be accepted. Photocopied homework solutions will not be accepted.\n3) TAs will provide helps in the use of software.\nExaminations.  The final exam will be administered as scheduled by the school. Examinations will be closed book and notes.\n1) Each student will be allowed a A4 sheet of handwritten “crib” notes for the exams. No photocopies or computer printouts will be allowed.\n2) No make-up exams will be given unless required by National Central University policies. Students who are eligible for a make-up exam or need extra time must contact the instructor at least one week prior to the exam date.\n3) Cheating in any form will not be tolerated.  Any student caught cheating will be censured in full accordance with National Central University policies.\""}, "outline": {"ch": "\"Week 1: Course Introduction/SAS Software Installation\nWeek 2:
