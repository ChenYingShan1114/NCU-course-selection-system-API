The protagonist, Zhang Wuji, after practicing the Great Shift of the Universe, suddenly gains further insights into various martial arts schools. In short, he sees the essence of martial arts. What martial arts characters see as the essence differs from what experts studying learning theories see, but there is a similarity in their understanding.\nLearning experts can see deeper structures, not just surface appearances. When they observe a learning phenomenon (for example, a group of children playing in a courtyard), they can interpret it from various perspectives such as language development, play, cognition, or socio-cultural aspects. They can choose appropriate theoretical perspectives to interpret how learning is designed and occurs.\nSome experts studying learning (such as learning scientists) can also simultaneously approach from different learning viewpoints to design learning contexts. Designing good learning experiences for learners is currently the most important skill for educators. This course aims to give students a taste of the insights and methods seen by learning experts.\nIt‘s important to emphasize that the curriculum currently presented is just a plan and hasn‘t been discussed with students. I hope to discuss and communicate with students in the first class, collectively constructing the content and format of this course while not altering its core values and principles. The ultimate goal of this course is not just to earn credits or get good grades. I hope that through this course, you can discover yourself and cultivate your own approach to understanding learning.\nTraining Content: Five Major “Learning Units“ We will explore methods of understanding learning through reading classic learning theory texts. This course is not a history of learning theory; rather, it focuses on several themes and theories related to “experts and novices“ in learning. The selected themes include five major “learning units“:\n1.Experts and Novices (1)\n2.Experts and Novices (2)\n3.Situated Cognition\n4.Learning Communities\n5.Designing Learning Communities\nTeaching Methodology\n1.Flipped Classroom: Each “learning unit“ begins with intensive study of designated articles as “learners,“ followed by online and face-to-face discussions. Face-to-face sessions aim to clarify and engage in in-depth conversations about the essence of the theories presented in the readings.\n2.Socratic Dialogue: Understanding the essence of learning theories through Socratic dialogue.\n3.Deep Reflection: Combining reading, discussion, and field observation research to make learning theories a tool for understanding learning."}, "textbook": {"ch": "Anderson, J.
