Term paper should not be longer than four pages, not including cover page, table-of-content page, reference list and abstract page.\nThe guidance for researching into your topic:\n1. What is your scheduling problem? Any academic/practical motivation for you to choose this topic?\n2. Process of searching for related papers?\n3. Positioning - by comparing your scheduling problem with those related papers:\na. Problem definition/motivation/research objective: Comment on definition/motivation/research objective in the related papers in light of your scheduling problem.\nb. Solving procedures: Comment on the solving procedures in each of related papers and, after that, point out the possible direction of the solving procedure which may be appropriate for your scheduling problem.\nc. Validation and evaluation: Comment on the validation and evaluation which are conducted in each of related papers and point out the possible validation and evaluation you may use for your research problem.\nd. Academic contribution: Point out the academic contribution of each paper you collect.\ne. What are possible further research directions? Why are they possible and important?\""}, "textbook": {"ch": "\"Textbook： Scheduling: Theory, Algorithms, and Systems (Springer, 2012) by Michael Pinedo   Agent in Taiwan：新月   Tel: (02) 02311-4027\"", "en": "\"Textbook： Scheduling: Theory, Algorithms, and Systems (Springer, 2012) by Michael Pinedo   Agent in Taiwan：新月   Tel: (02) 02311-4027\""}, "selfCompiledRate": {"ch": "20", "en": "20"}, "instructMethod": {"ch": "講授\n研討\n實習/實驗", "en": ["Lecture", "Seminar", "Practical Training Lab"]}, "gradMethod": {"ch": "\"Assignment 30%\nMid term test 35%\nFinal test 35%\"", "en": "\"Assignment 30%\nMid term test 35%\nFinal test 35%\""}, "officeHour": {"ch": "Wed 09:30~11:30 am  at I1-735", "en": "Wed 09:30~11:30 am  at I1-735"}, "teachWeeks": {"ch": "18", "en": "18"}, "flexDiscription": {"ch": "", "en": ""}, "domain": {"ch": "研究方法\n\n\n、\n\n\n供應鏈管理\n\n\n、\n\n\n規劃與控制", "en": "研究方法\n\n\n、\n\n\n供應鏈管理\n\n\n、\n\n\n規劃與控制"}, "map": {"ch": [{"competencies": "原創性", "rating": "(3)普通", "assesments": ["紙筆測驗/會考", "作業練習"]}, {"competencies": "熟悉其專業領域文獻", "rating": "(3)普通", "assesments": ["紙筆測驗/會考", "作業練習"]}, {"competencies": "獨立思考和解決問題能力", "rating": "(5)非常高", "assesments": ["紙筆測驗/會考", "作業練習"]}, {"competencies": "溝通能力", "rating": "(3)普通", "assesments": ["紙筆測驗/會考", "作業練習", "出席/課堂表現"]}], "en": [{"competencies": "Original Contribution", "rating": "(3)Medium", "assesments": ["Test/Exam", "Assignments"]}, {"competencies": "Proficiency with Discipline-related Literature", "rating": "(3)Medium", "assesments": ["Test/Exam", "Assignments"]}, {"competencies": "Critical Thinking and Problem-solving", "rating": "(5)VeryHigh", "assesments": ["Test/Exam", "Assignments"]}, {"competencies": "Communication Skill", "rating": "(3)Medium", "assesments": ["Test/Exam", "Assignments", "Attendance/Performance"]}]}, "assignCriteria": {"ch": ["學制:限碩士班、博士班。"], "en": ["Type:Master's Program、Doctoral Program only."]}, "preselecStu": 0, "stuGender": {"male": 0, "Female": 0}, "stuGrade": {"doctor": {}, "master": {}, "bachelor": {}}, "stus": []}
