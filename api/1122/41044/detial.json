This subject is best taught using case studies and demonstrated by seasoned practitioner who have weathered at least one complete real-estate cycle.  In the past, this professional discipline bridges finance/accounting, as well as project management. Hence, professionals from either discipline are required to learn the rest on the job.  The result is not necessarily satisfying as they tend to lack hands-on knowledge in decision making. The key architecture component to the discipline is usually filled by outsourced consultants from land scrivener or architecture background.  Given the large investment nature and importance on company balance sheet, it is vital that a more consolidated and professional approach be taken in school education so that students could be better trained to understand the upside and the risks involved in each  undertaking. \n\nReal cases will be presented in class, with focus on 4 aspects of investment, listed in sequence of development stages-- \n\n1.Land：City Zoning and Financial Implications.\n2.Construction: Cost Breakdown and Budgeting.\n3.Risks in Construction Management: Contractual risks, Financial risks, Management risks, Procurement and Vendor selection risks.\n4.Finance: Financial structure, Leverage, related risks and contingency plans.  D/E ratio, market analysis.\n5.Operation and Management: Marketing plan, Pre-Opening plans, Operations SOP, Scheduling, CAPEX plans. \n\nReal-Estate Categories will be presented in class, ranging from commercial office to hotels, shopping mall, retails and restaurants.
