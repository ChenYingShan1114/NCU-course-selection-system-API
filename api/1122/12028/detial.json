If you are NOT an English \ngraduate student, you will not be able to enroll given the objectives of my course. \n\nThis theory-based course concentrates on the notion of \nepistemic injustice which intersects conceptual matrices \nin epistemology, political and moral philosophy. \nContemporary social epistemologists have turned their \nattention from ideal epistemic situations to quotidian \ncontexts in which social identity and power play a \nsignificant role in the way we evaluate others’ statements and ours. Spaces of injustice where practical and \ntheoretical knowledge is produced, disseminated, and \nassessed are not rare. This course seeks to provide \nstudents with philosophical tools to reflect on such \nspaces. To do so, we will examine two forms of epistemic injustice: testimonial and hermeneutical, both introduced by British philosopher Miranda Fricker in her 2007 \nmonograph Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of \nKnowing. We will pay attention to what is characteristic of \nthem, cases illustrating them, and references preceding and following M. Fricker’s introduction of the terms."}, "outline": {"ch": "Please refer to English version.", "en": "ALL COURSE CONTENT WILL BE PROVIDED IN\nENGLISH.\nAll weekly sessions comprise (i) a lecturing part; and (ii) a\ndiscussion section.\nThis three-part course is motivated by the following\nquestions:\nIntroduction: What is ‘epistemic injustice’ within the area\nof social epistemology?\nSection 1: What is testimonial injustice?\nSection 2: What is hermeneutical injustice?"}, "textbook": {"ch": "Please refer to English version.", "en": "A copy of the course material will be ready on February \n19.
