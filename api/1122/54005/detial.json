Therefore, authentic contexts are very meaningful and relevant to students during their learning process. In this course, we will focus on learning in authentic contexts using advanced technology to facilitate students to develop high-level cognition like creativity with scalability and sustainability. Clarke, Dede, Ketelhut, and Nelson (2006) defined scalability as an ability to learning programs and design to be adapted in a wide variety of contexts and they used the term sustainability to refer to an ability to learn programs to remain in use. Creativity is the use of knowledge, imagination, and judgment by students to solve problems in an innovative, high quality, and appropriate manner. Therefore, how to consider the above three abilities in learning design becomes very critical to get a success in education. This is because learning in authentic context with help of advanced technologies can potentially realize the above three abilities and complement traditional learning in class/at school."}, "outline": {"ch": "Schedules of course:\nCreative learning with scalability and sustainability\nPart I  EFL Speaking in Authentic contexts\n1.
