Introduction:\nThis book is about combustion science and technology and, as such, covers not only the basic laws and phenomena related to the physics and chemistry of combustion, but also the implications of the fundamental understanding gaining therein to the principles behind the practical combustion phenomena affecting our daily lives.\n1. Chemical thermodynamics:\nChemical thermodynamics is concerned with the description of the equilibrium states of reacting multicomponent systems. Compared to single-component systems in which only thermal equilibrium is required, we are now also interested in chemical equilibrium among all of the components.\n2. Chemical kinetics:\nIn this chapter, we first present the phenomenological law describing the general dependence of reaction rates on reactant concentrations and temperature. We then discuss multistep reactions and some approximation techniques used to simplify the representation of these reaction.\n3. Oxidation mechanisms of fuels:\nIn this chapter we discuss the oxidation mechanisms of specific fuel systems involving hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and various hydrocarbons. The formation of pollutions will also be covered. In particular, the reaction pathways leading to fuel consumption, the formation and destruction of intermediate species, and the final product formation are discussed in a qualitative manner.\n4. Transport phenomena:\nWhen the molecules in any region of a fluid medium possess an excess of energy, concentration, or momentum, such that gradients of these properties exist in the neighborhood of this region, the system will attempt to restore spatial uniformity by transporting the relevant property in the direction of the deficient region. The transport occurs even in the absence of any bulk motion in this direction.\n5. Conservation equations:\nThe dynamics and thermodynamics of a chemically reacting flow are governed by the conservation laws of mass, momentum, energy, and the concentration of the individual species. In this chapter, we shall first present a derivation of these conservation equations based on control volume considerations, We shall then derive a simplified form of these equations describing only those effects which are of predominant importance in most of the subsonic combustion phenomena to be studied later.\n6. Laminar nonpremixed flames:\nEither by nature or design, in most combustion systems fuel and oxidizer are initially spatially separated. If the subsequent mixing between them is not sufficiently fast before chemical reaction is initiated, then the mixing and reaction will take place only in thin reaction zones that separate them.\n7. Laminar premixed flames:\nIn this chapter we shall study the simplest, idealized mode propagation, namely the steady propagation of a one-dimensional, planar, adiabatic, wave relative to a stationary, combustible mixture in the doubly infinite domain. We shall call such a wave a standard wave or standard flame.\n8. Limit phenomena:\nIn this chapter we shall study the transition between burning and nonburning states, namely phenomena involving ignition, extinction, flame stabilization and blowoff, and flammability.\"", "en": "\"0.
