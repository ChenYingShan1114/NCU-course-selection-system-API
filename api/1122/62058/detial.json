In the past two decades, it has seen significant advancements due to the rapid increase in data size and computing speed. Many promising new concepts and models have emerged. This course welcomes individuals with a background in statistics and programming. Through reading and hands-on projects, you will delve into cutting-edge statistical models in environmental science and learn how to use these models to decompose the ways the Earth‘s system runs."}, "outline": {"ch": "Syllabus: https://whyjz.github.io/ncu-env-data-science/syllabus.html\n建議您在參加本課程之前先獲取統計學和程式設計的必要知識。請查看此網頁：https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/supervised_learning.html — 如果能在合理的閱讀時間內理解此處介紹的大部分想法和步驟，那麼您已經準備好迎接本課程的新挑戰 :)\nPart 1\n統計檢定：環境因子間有無相互影響？ (Weeks 1-3)\nPart 2\n回歸模型：為什麼正則化如此重要？ (Weeks 4-6)\nPart 3\n神經網路：如何相信深不見底的模型？ (Weeks 7-9)\nPart 4\n核方法：維度是詛咒也是祝福？ (Weeks 10-12)\nPart 5\n隨機森林：一個模型不夠就多做幾次？ (Weeks 13-15)\nPart 6\n期末黑客團隊專題發表 (Week 16)\n其他資料科學的主題（例如主成份分析、聚類分析等等）則是指定閱讀的材料，我們會課堂上進行互動式討論。\n程式設計作業可以使用任何語言完成，不過我對 Python 與 Matlab 比較熟，能提供比較多協助。", "en": "Syllabus: https://whyjz.github.io/ncu-env-data-science/syllabus.html\nI recommend you acquire the necessary knowledge about statistics and programming before taking this course.
