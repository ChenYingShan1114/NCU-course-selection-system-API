Therefore, authentic contexts are very meaningful and relevant to students during their learning process. In this course, we will focus on learning in authentic contexts using advanced technology to facilitate students to develop high-level cognition like creativity with scalability and sustainability. Clarke, Dede, Ketelhut, and Nelson (2006) defined scalability as an ability to learning programs and design to be adapted in a wide variety of contexts and they used the term sustainability to refer to an ability to learn programs to remain in use. Creativity is the use of knowledge, imagination, and judgment by students to solve problems in an innovative, high quality, and appropriate manner. Therefore, how to consider the above three abilities in learning design becomes very critical to get a success in education. This is because learning in authentic context with help of advanced technologies can potentially realize the above three abilities and complement traditional learning in class/at school.", "ch": "真實情境反映了學生在現實生活中運用知識的方式，真實情境下的學習活動反映了人們在現實世界中所進行的活動。因此真實的情境在學習過程中，對學生來說是非常有意義的。在這課程中，我們重點是學習真實的情境並透過先進科技的輔助以促進學生發展高層次認知能力像可持續性和可擴展性的創造力。Clarke、Dede、Ketelhut和Nelson將可擴展性定義為能夠在各種環境下學習課程的能力，並使用“可持續性”來指學習課程以繼續與持續使用的能力。創造力是學生運用知識、想像力和判斷力以創新、高質量、與適當的方式解決問題。因此如何考慮上述三種能力在設計學習內容或活動時，對於成功教育是至關重要，尤其是先進的科技改變了學習課程，並給了傳統教室上課一個學習的機會將真實實踐與應用在真實情境中相互結合。從而可能獲得可擴展性、可持續性和創造性的全面與完整的學習設計。這是因為在先進的科技幫助下，在真實環境中學習有潛力實現以上三種能力並強化課堂/學校中的傳統學習。這課程研究生將實務學習到”可持續性和可擴展性真實環境實施創造性學習”。"}, "content": {"en": "Schedules of course:\nCreative learning with scalability and sustainability\nPart I EFL Speaking in Authentic contexts\n1.
