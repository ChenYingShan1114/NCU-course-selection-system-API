This is a graduate level course so we assume students have basic knowledge about digital logic and IC design. We will discuss modern digital logic IC design techniques, challenges, and some possible solutions. Specifically, we will discuss several important algorithms in high level synthesis, logic synthesis, and physical design, which contain modeling, architectural synthesis, logic synthesis, partitioning, floorplanning, placement, and routing. We will also address important design considerations including area, power, security, reliability, and performance during different design stages, and explain the difficulties under current technologies. Most lecturing materials come from recently published papers, book chapters, and newsletters. After taking this course, you will clearly understand major challenges of digital logic IC design nowadays under different conditions/considerations at different design stage, and have some basic ideas about how academic/commercial tools address these problems. You also can know hot research topics and problems in the field. Finally, you may have chance to practice these algorithms/techniques on some small designs. This course will include lectures, programming assignments, 1 Final Exam, and a paper presentation.\"", "ch": "\"本課程目標在於指導同學在電子設計自動化領域裡之重要議題。我們將探討高階合成、邏輯合成及實體設計之重要演算法，包含modeling, architectural synthesis, logic synthesis, partitioning, floorplanning, placement 及 routing。詳記說明請參閱外文之課程目標。\""}, "content": {"en": "\" Introduction\n Modeling\n Scheduling\n Resource binding\n Boolean representation\n Two-level logic optimization\n Multi-level logic optimization\n Technology mapping\n Partitioning\n Floorplanning\n Placement\n Global Routing\n Detailed Routing\n Clock and Power Routing\n Emerging topics\"", "ch": "\" Introduction\n Modeling\n Scheduling\n Resource binding\n Boolean representation\n Two-level logic optimization\n Multi-level logic optimization\n Technology mapping\n Partitioning\n Floorplanning\n Placement\n Global Routing\n Detailed Routing\n Clock and Power Routing\n Emerging topics\""}, "textbook": {"en": "Slides from lecturer", "ch": "Slides from lecturer"}, "self_comp": {"en": "100", "ch": "100"}, "method": {"en": "Lecture Seminar Others", "ch": "講授 研討 其他"}, "grading": {"en": "\"Programming Assignments 55% Final Exam 20% Final Project 15% Paper Presentation 10% Bonus Points ??%\"", "ch": "\"Programming Assignments 55% Final Exam 20% Final Project 15% Paper Presentation 10% Bonus Points ??%\""}, "office_hr": {"en": "TBD", "ch": "TBD"}, "teach_week": {"en": "16+2", "ch": "16+2"}, "flex_desc": {"en": "We will provide on-line video for week17/18", "ch": "第17/18週將提供線上課程教材"}, "domain": {"en": "IC設計", "ch": "IC設計"}, "map": {"en": [{"competency": "Engineering Knowledge", "rate": "(4) High", "Assessments": "Test/Exam ， Assignments ， Presentation/Oral Exam ， Practices/Experiments"}, {"competency": "Investigation and Implementation", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Assignments ， Practices/Experiments"}, {"competency": "Project Management", "rate": "(3) Medium", "Assessments": "Practices/Experiments ， Attendance/Performance ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}, {"competency": "Problem Analysis and Independent Working", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Test/Exam ， Assignments ， Presentation/Oral Exam"}, {"competency": "Engineering Integration", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Test/Exam ， Assignments ， Presentation/Oral Exam"}, {"competency": "Communication and Team Work", "rate": "(3) Medium", "Assessments": "Attendance/Performance ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}, {"competency": "Writing Skill and Presentation", "rate": "(3) Medium", "Assessments": "Assignments"}, {"competency": "Environment caring and Life-long Learning", "rate": "(1) Very Low", "Assessments": "Attendance/Performance"}, {"competency": "Ethics and Intellectual Property Respect", "rate": "(3) Medium", "Assessments": "Assignments ， Practices/Experiments"}], "ch": [{"competency": "運用工程知識", "rate": "(4) 高", "Assessments": "紙筆測驗/會考 ， 作業練習 ， 口頭報告/口試 ， 實作/實驗"}, {"competency": "實作能力", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "作業練習 ， 實作/實驗"}, {"competency": "領導管理", "rate": "(3) 普通", "Assessments": "實作/實驗 ， 出席/課堂表現 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}, {"competency": "分析/獨立解決能力", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "紙筆測驗/會考 ， 作業練習 ， 口頭報告/口試"}, {"competency": "工程整合能力", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "紙筆測驗/會考 ， 作業練習 ， 口頭報告/口試"}, {"competency": "溝通/協調/團隊合作", "rate": "(3) 普通", "Assessments": "出席/課堂表現 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}, {"competency": "論文寫作/語文表達", "rate": "(3) 普通", "Assessments": "作業練習"}, {"competency": "環境影響/終生學習", "rate": "(1) 非常低", "Assessments": "出席/課堂表現"}, {"competency": "工程倫理/尊重智產", "rate": "(3) 普通", "Assessments": "作業練習 ， 實作/實驗"}]}, "asign_crite": {"en": [], "ch": []}, "prelim_sel": 40, "gender": {"male": 29, "female": 11}, "stu_depart": {"en": {"Department of Electrical Engineering": 18, "Division of Computational and Data Sciences, Department of Mathematics": 1, "Opto-Mechatronics Engineering Program , Department of Mechanical Engineering": 2, "Department of Communication Engineering": 1, "Interdisciplinary Program of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science": 4, "Department of Computer Science and Elec.
