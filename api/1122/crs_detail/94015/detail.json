Statistics are used in a variety of contexts ranging from scientific experiments to political advertisements and beyond. This statistics course introduces the basic concepts of statistical analysis, with a focus on both univariate (single-variable) and bivariate (two-variable) data. The course starts with an introductory examination and display of data. Analysis of univariate/bivariate data by way of measures of central tendency (such as the mean or average), dispersion (such as the variance), asymmetry, and associations for both qualitative and quantitative data is presented. We then move to the probability theory and statistics terms. The relationship of probability to statistics is also discussed, providing students with the tools they need to understand how ``chance' plays a role in statistical analysis. Statistical distributions, with a focus on the normal distribution and its uses, are also considered next, followed by an introduction to various sampling theory and statistical testing. Some fundamental tests without parametric assumptions will be addressed. We continue to explore the conditional models from linear regression model via OLS, and analysis of variance. The student is provided with enough theory and sufficient practice to conduct statistical analyses for real life cases. This course is designed for anyone who desires to learn how statistics can produce better decisions and insights from the growing amount of data generated in modern business.\"", "ch": "\"本課程旨在引導管院大二的同學建構社會科學中科學性論述的基礎 -- 統計分析。面對資訊紛沓雜陳的時代，如何將手邊既有的資料轉化為可以利用的訊息，以輔助面對諸多不確定性下的各種決策與判斷，我們需要一套可以幫助我們洞察資訊內涵的工具與方法，統計分析恰如其份地扮演這樣角色。本學期的課程初期我們將介紹一些現實世界所接觸實際資料的型態與特性，如何以科學性角度看待、觀察這些資料，並彙整出我們在決策時所需的資訊與洞見(insight)。課程接著鋪陳出機率觀念、何謂隨機變數?掌握的訊息集合與條件機率之關係、常見的分配型態、相關分析的範疇、統計檢定與推論的基本概念等。 下學期的課程則延伸上學期的基礎至不同群體的比較、變異數分析與迴歸分析。我們亦將同時在課程中嘗試以不同的個案與實例，結合理論說明各個統計觀念與模型的所蘊含的直觀意義與操作，並透過實習讓學生實地操作演練套裝軟體 (如 Excel 等) 如何輔助我們進行統計分析。祈能透過札實的統計基礎建構，厚植日後學生在高年級中對其他進階之專業課程乃至於未來在商業界求職或日後有志繼續深造時，掌握進行財務金融、經濟與行銷等商學管理領域所需的工具與分析方法，決勝於泛商學不同的專業領域。\""}, "content": {"en": "Statistics is a field of study that concerns the collection of data as well as the process of extracting information from it in order to make prediction or decisions.
