This subject is best taught using case studies and demonstrated by seasoned practitioner who have weathered at least one complete real-estate cycle. In the past, this professional discipline bridges finance/accounting, as well as project management. Hence, professionals from either discipline are required to learn the rest on the job. The result is not necessarily satisfying as they tend to lack hands-on knowledge in decision making. The key architecture component to the discipline is usually filled by outsourced consultants from land scrivener or architecture background. Given the large investment nature and importance on company balance sheet, it is vital that a more consolidated and professional approach be taken in school education so that students could be better trained to understand the upside and the risks involved in each undertaking. Real cases will be presented in class, with focus on 4 aspects of investment, listed in sequence of development stages-- 1. Land：City Zoning and Financial Implications. 2. Construction: Cost Breakdown and Budgeting. 3. Risks in Construction Management: Contractual risks, Financial risks, Management risks, Procurement and Vendor selection risks. 4. Finance: Financial structure, Leverage, related risks and contingency plans. D/E ratio, market analysis. 5. Operation and Management: Marketing plan, Pre-Opening plans, Operations SOP, Scheduling, CAPEX plans. Real-Estate Categories will be presented in class, ranging from commercial office to hotels, shopping mall, retails and restaurants. Financial models will be shared.", "ch": "商業不動產類別和投資架構：商業不動產投資的特色，是大金額中長期投資標的。雖然現金流量分析的評估方法，也廣泛使用於公共基礎建設，例如:高鐵、電廠、捷運和機場等投資案。但一來這些項目屬於特殊專門標的，專業性質高，不適於廣泛應用。另一方面，由於基礎設施的土地多為政府提供，或涉及公私部門合作的特殊約定，固然這些項目雖然有趣，卻不在本課授課範圍。本堂課討論的範圍，限於商業不動產，例如商辦、廠房、購物中心、旅館。所關注的除了標的本身的評估方式以外，也涉及混合式投資架構評估，例如: 銀行借款、發行公司債、股票溢價發行、REIT等等。 個案的開發分期和因素，包括但不限於：  土地：都市計畫土地使用分區、建築法規分析、使用類別、面積計算。  營建：營建成本、合約風險、營建管理、承包商財務能力、工程採購施工(Engineering, Procurement, Construction, EPC)文件審核。  財務：財務架構和風險，D/E比例(舉債比例)、市場參數假設。  營運：招商計畫、招商策略、營運計畫、風險控管計劃、期程(Schedules)計畫、資本支出(Capex)計畫等。"}, "content": {"en": "1 ( / ) Location, Planning Law, and Zoning related issues\n2 ( / ) Real Estate Development Pre-conditions and Categories\n3 ( / ) Commercial Office BOT (Built-Operate Transfer) Bidding Preparations\n4 ( / ) Commercial Development Project Finance Considerations\n5 ( / ) Commercial Mixed-use Project Construction Tender and Pre-Lease\n6 ( / ) Shopping Mall Investment Evaluation\n7 ( / ) Shopping Mall Syndicate Loan Evaluation and Financial Modelling\n8 ( / ) Other Fixed-income Project Categories\n9 ( / ) Corporate Real Estate (CRE) Introduction\n10 ( / ) Facilities Planning and Budgeting\n11 ( / ) Capital Expenditure and Budgeting\n12 ( / ) CRE Leasing and Project Management\n13 ( / ) Benchmarking and Market Comparable\n14 ( / ) REIT, REAT, Distressed Asset.
