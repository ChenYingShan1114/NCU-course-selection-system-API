The main scope of the course is to be able to obtain 3D surface/topography models for any further scientific fields and aspects as: geomorphology, structural geology, hydrology, hydrogeology, vulcanology, etc., for surveys as: coastal erosion, landscape reorganization, environment changes, river system evolution, glaciers retreat, lands subsidence, natural hazards as landslides and earthquakes, and many others. On the basis of the lecture, students are expected to understand and be able to manually acquire aerial images using drones (UAV) then process them and generate images to build 3D maps as DSM (digital surface models).
