In this course, we will read and analyze the 1970s radical care activism (the People’s Drug Program). The People’s Drug Program was initiated by people of color radical activists including the Black Panther Party, the Republic of New Afrika, and the Young Lords. Its goal was to provide socialized care for drug rehabilitation by employing acupuncture. We will start with this program as a point of inter-Asia referencing across continents to reflect upon underlying interconnections of histories, activisms, practices and struggles in the “third world” contexts that inspire the radical ideas of revolutionary care, and how its decolonial views on people, society and the world offer critical insights in these times of high uncertainty. This requires engaged investigation of theories, concepts, and categories developed by existing critical scholarship, as well as careful analysis of cultural texts across disciplinary demarcations and knowledge divisions.
