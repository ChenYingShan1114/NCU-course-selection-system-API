Statistics is the foundation of testing hypothesis scientifically for the social science field. Statistics helps convert data to important information and leads to analyses, predictions, and decision makings. After this semester, students are expected to understand the basic theories, to be able to derive important formulas, and to apply statistics to address the issues in business and management.", "ch": "本課程引導學生了解統計學原理及其可應用範疇。統計學是社會科學領域進行科學性驗證論述的基礎， 將資料轉為重要的訊息並協助判斷、制定決策及分析預測。預期學生將能理解基本統計理論，能夠進行推導，並能將統計學應用於資料以協助處理管理領域問題。"}, "content": {"en": "The course will extend the idea of sampling distributions and confidence interval to the concepts of how to form a hypothesis and how to set the rejection area based on a single sample.
