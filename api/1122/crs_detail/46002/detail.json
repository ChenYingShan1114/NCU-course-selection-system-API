Successful applications of these models require a sound understanding of both the underlying theory and the practical problems that are encountered in using the models in real-life situation. In this course, theoretical ideas are presented to the degree needed for good understanding in making sound application. The course is intended for students who have completed a first course in statistical methods. The background course should include at least some techniques of descriptive statistics, the normal distribution, and an introduction to basic concepts of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for means and variance. Some advanced topics require some familiarity with matrix algebra.\n Learn how to identify situations where DOE models are necessary and beneficial, and how to develop experimental procedures for possible applications.\n Learn the terminology and mathematical notation used in DOE models.\n Learn how to use computer software for DOE, including reading the results/outputs.\nStimulate general interest in statistics.\nClass Participation. Class participation is crucial for learning the course content and for keeping in pace with the class progress.\n1) You should be prepared for each class and should try to contribute to class discussions. Active and cooperative learning will be encouraged. During the lecture, you are expected to answer/raise questions, and participate in small-group activities such as modeling and solving problems, and interpreting solutions.\n2) You should read the assigned sections from the textbook and any other course material that is posted online.\n3) Attendance will be taken in classes and will constitute part of your participation grade.\nHomework Assignments. You will apply the concepts learnt in class to a variety of problems. The assignments have been taken from the textbook unless specified otherwise. Homework assignments must be prepared individually.\n1) All assignments should be prepared professionally. Every assignment must include your name and student ID number. Unorganized, illegible, or incomplete assignments will not be graded.\n2) Homeworks will be posted at least one week prior to their due date. Late assignments will not be accepted. Photocopied homework solutions will not be accepted\n3) Homework solutions will be posted on the course web page the same day they are collected.\nExaminations. One exam and a final exam will be administered as scheduled by the school. Examinations will be closed book and notes.\n1) Each student will be allowed a A4 sheet of handwritten “crib” notes for the exams. No photocopies or computer printouts will be allowed.\n2) No make-up exams will be given unless required by National Central University policies. Students who are eligible for a make-up exam or need extra time must contact the instructor at least one week prior to the exam date.\nCheating in any form will not be tolerated. Any student caught cheating will be censured in full accordance with National Central University policies.\"", "ch": "\"Design and Analysis of Experiments (DOE or DOX) is widely used today in engineering, physics, chemistry, electronic and pharmaceutical industry, agriculture, and biological/biomedical sciences.
