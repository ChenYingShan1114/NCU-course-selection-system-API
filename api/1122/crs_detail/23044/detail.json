The functionality can only be understand from knowledge of their atomistic structure and morphology.\nThe present lecture is aimed to teach methods of structural characterization, classified by the different types of nanomaterials.\nOnly recently X-ray diffraction has been realized as suitable tool in nanoscience.\nX-rays can penetrate into the bulk and the surrounding ambient to allow for structural studies under in situ conditions.\nHigh-resolution electron microscopy is still the most frequently used tool for exploring the nanomaterial structures. Both techniques compliment each other: HRTEM is a local probe, while XRD samples over a large volume therefore gives an integral probe of the structure.\nIn addition, surface sensitive methods will be discussed: STM (scanning tunneling microscopy) and AFM (atomic force microscopy) as probe for planar nanostructures.“", "ch": "“The lecture will be delivered in English.
