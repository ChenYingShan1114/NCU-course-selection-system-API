modules:\n(1) Module 1: Environment-Human interactions\n­ Critically analyze the past, present, and future of the anthroposphere and the implications for getting into sustainable development.\n­ Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the role of humans as a cause of – but also solution to – environmental problems.\n­ Develop enough understanding to navigate and critically analyze the key aspects and developments in health and environment deterioration.\n(2) Module 2: Societal systems\n­ Engage critically with the resilient urban system through the lens of living-space management.\n­ Consider the interlinkages between different environmental compartments such as water, food, and energy from a management perspective.\n­ Develop a critical understanding of the trajectories of the sustainable system for consumption and production.\n(3) Module 3: Environmental Governance\n­ Understand environmental ethics that are re-shaping social and environmental relationships.\n­ Integrate transition possible in each of the socio-technical frontiers of governance into policy analysis.\n­ Learn and apply methods for risk assessment and integrate relevant natural science knowledge.\n­ Apply methods, concepts, and frameworks to case study material on multiple conflicting interests between government and stakeholders.\n(4) Module 4: Integration and Methodology\n­ Compare and critique frameworks for contextualizing transdisciplinary approaches that might drive and accelerate change towards sustainable development.\n­ Acquire the ability to go from real-world problems with these features to possible solutions.", "ch": "The course objectives are addressed through four core modules:\n(1) Module 1: Environment-Human interactions\n­ Critically
