Two semester courses will establish the students with the basic and core knowledges as well as the theories of solar terrestrial plasma interaction and earth’s magnetosphere. The students will be equipped with the physics of massive charged particles interacting with the electric and magnetic fields in outer and inner magnetospheric environments which will help conduct space and magnetospheric physics research.\"", "ch": "地球磁層為太空電漿環境之重要核心結構。本課程為磁層物理I之延續，探討地球磁尾及內磁層之帶電粒子、電場、磁場及電流等之物理，並介紹磁層及電離層偶合之基本概念及物理模式。兩學期之課程將建立學生日地交互作用及地球磁層電漿環境之重要知識及理論基礎。對於磁層環境中大量帶電粒子及電磁場的動力及物理過程有深度的認識及理解，建立磁層物理研究之基礎。"}, "content": {"en": "\"The physics of charged particles, electric, magnetic fields and plasma currents in the magnetospheric configuration and magnetotail.
