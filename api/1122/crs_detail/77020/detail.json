The new technological application of the metaverse concept will be of high value in education and will become the most heated research topic in recent years. In addition, the Metaverse brings a new look to innovative teaching and enables teaching activities to develop teaching methods that are different from the past. At the same time, it is more likely to change learners' behaviors and emotional expressions, helping learners to improve their learning effectiveness. Therefore, this course will teach students the understanding of the Metaverse, the teaching tools that the Metaverse can use, and the demonstration cases for educating the Metaverse. This course will be based on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development) adopted by the UN Sustainable Development Summit in 2015, with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to achieve in the future. The co-prosperity of humanity and the earth. Therefore, this course will guide students to understand the SDGs, including related content, practices, and cases. Moreover, try to design teaching plans in the educational metaverse environment.", "ch": "隨著科技的快速發展與整合應用，促使科技應用將進入下一個里程碑，這也讓人們關注「元宇宙（Metaverse）」，元宇宙的概念被認為將會對於當代教學方法影響深遠，更顯見運用元宇宙概念的新科技應用在教育領域中，將具有高度價值，將成為近年最熱烈討論的研究議題。此外，元宇宙不僅為創新教學帶來全新樣貌，更使教學活動發展出有別以往之教學方法，同時更可能改變學習者的行為與情意表現，幫助學習者提升學習成效。因此本課程將教導修課學生對於元宇宙的認知、元宇宙能運用的教學工具、教育元宇宙示範案例等。本課程將以聯合國永續發展會議(UN Sustainable Development Summit)，於2015年時通過2030年永續發展議程(2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development)，合計17項永續發展目標(SDGs)，以達成在未來人類與地球的共榮。因此，本課程將引導修課學生對於SDGs的認識，包括相關內容、作法與案例等。並且嘗試於教育元宇宙環境中，設計教學方案。"}, "content": {"en": "Each group needs to plan and use various instructional media to allow others to learn the content of a specific topic, including the theme, scope, method of delivery, and assessment format.
