The course provides an experiential learning environment in which students can practice and integrate knowledge and skills obtained in the BBA degree, and understand real-world business needs and issues. It also enables students to work effectively as a member of a small team and interact with clients.“", "ch": "本課程目標是藉由專題製作來讓同學將要製作的專題置入企業組織與運作中去了解其問題與需求，並學習思考如何透過資訊科技來加以改善或解決，過程中將整合過去所學的企管知識，系統分析與設計、程式語言、資料庫等知識，並學習以團隊合作的方式來完成。"}, "content": {"en": "“The class is mainly instructed in regular seminars and meetings. The content of the course in this semester mainly refers to the brainstorming of the system concepts (Phase I) and the development of the user requirements (Phase II) in this capstone-stone project following the agile development approach. Work products of the two phases include the project proposal (for phase I), system requirement specifications (for Phase II), and weekly meeting minutes that record the context of the project development.“", "ch": "本課程主要是讓學生將過去所學的課程能夠綜合應用在一個完整的應用程式開發機會，並以敏捷專案的形式完成專題的實作。授課內容以當周的開發進度與主題進行教學與機會教育；學生同時接受團隊合作與實務開發的實際訓練。專題過程中並會提供適當的補充教材例如軟體開發方法、軟體專案管理以及團隊合作模式等等，以加強學生軟體開發實務的知識。"}, "textbook": {"en": "“1.
