After a brief review of the general field of ethics, with a particular focus on normative ethics and the main ethical theories of consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics, we will discuss how we can use those theories (and ethical reasoning more generally) to address major ethical issues at the center of contemporary human life. We will focus on how people think and debate about everyday issues and how do we put ethics into practice? Do we have an obligation to devote some of our resources to help those living in severe poverty, and if so, how demanding is that obligation? How ought we treat animals and the environment? What do we think about the ethics of death penalty practices? What is economic justice, and what does that mean for the way we think about poverty in our society and beyond? These issues, among others, will be considered in Practical Ethics.\"", "ch": "倫理判斷是當代人必備的基礎哲學素養，知易行難則是大家共通的困境，我們需要透過道德鍛鍊將學習到的道德理論付諸實踐。因此本課程旨在通過反思我們在實踐中關注的內容來闡明道德，希望同學除了能掌握普遍的道德原理外，同時知道要如何處理特殊的倫理案例。課程內容關注我們如何思考和辯論日常問題：我們應該如何對待動物和環境？我們對囚犯的待遇如何反映我們的價值觀？我們如何看待刑罰的道德規範？什麼是經濟正義，我們有沒有人道救援的義務？如何考慮國內社會及外國的貧窮困境？這些問題將在實踐倫理學中獲得充分討論。"}, "content": {"en": "\" 關於倫理(About Ethics)\n 平等的意義(Equality and Its Implications)\n 道德的起源(The Origins of Morality)\n 效益論倫理學(Utilitarianism)\n 義務論倫理學(Deontology)\n 道德相對主義(Moral Relativism)\n 動物平等權(Equality for Animals)\n 奪取生命的反思(Taking Life)\n 富裕與貧窮(Rich and Poor)\n 環境(The Environment)\"", "ch": "\" 關於倫理(About Ethics)\n 平等的意義(Equality and Its Implications)\n 道德的起源(The Origins of Morality)\n 效益論倫理學(Utilitarianism)\n 義務論倫理學(Deontology)\n 道德相對主義(Moral Relativism)\n 動物平等權(Equality for Animals)\n 奪取生命的反思(Taking Life)\n 富裕與貧窮(Rich and Poor)\n 環境(The Environment)\""}, "textbook": {"en": "\"Singer, Peter, 2011, Practical Ethics, New York: Cambridge.\"", "ch": "彼得?辛格著，《實踐倫理學》。東方出版社，2005。"}, "self_comp": {"en": "80", "ch": "80"}, "method": {"en": "Lecture", "ch": "講授"}, "grading": {"en": "\"Attendance and discussion 20% Oral presentation 20% Mid-term exam 30% Final exam 30%\"", "ch": "\"1.課堂參與、討論20% ; 2.課堂報告20%； 3.期中考30% 4.期末考30%。\""}, "office_hr": {"en": "\"Friday, 8-9AM\"", "ch": "\"週五,8-9點\""}, "teach_week": {"en": "18", "ch": "18"}, "flex_desc": {"en": "", "ch": ""}, "domain": {"en": "人文與文化研究領域 、 社會思潮領域 、 法政領域", "ch": "人文與文化研究領域 、 社會思潮領域 、 法政領域"}, "map": {"en": [{"competency": "The basic ability of Hakka language and culture", "rate": "(0)", "Assessments": "No assessment"}, {"competency": "The academic ability of social sciences", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Test/Exam ， Presentation/Oral Exam ， Research Report(printed on paper)"}, {"competency": "The spirit of humanity", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Test/Exam ， Presentation/Oral Exam ， Research Report(printed on paper)"}, {"competency": "The perspectives to reflect times changes and to create new developmen", "rate": "(3) Medium", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Research Report(printed on paper)"}], "ch": [{"competency": "具備客家語言文化的基本能力", "rate": "(0) 無", "Assessments": "無"}, {"competency": "具備社會科學的學科能力", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "紙筆測驗/會考 ， 口頭報告/口試 ， 專題研究報告(書面)"}, {"competency": "具備人文關懷的精神", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "紙筆測驗/會考 ， 口頭報告/口試 ， 專題研究報告(書面)"}, {"competency": "具備掌握時勢脈動與創新發展的視野", "rate": "(3) 普通", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 專題研究報告(書面)"}]}, "asign_crite": {"en": ["Department:Department of Hakka Language and Social Sciences only.", "Type:Undergraduate Program only."], "ch": ["系所:限客家語文暨社會科學學系。", "學制:限學士班。"]}, "prelim_sel": 23, "gender": {"male": 8, "female": 15}, "stu_depart": {"en": {"Department of Hakka Language and Social Sciences": 19, "Division of Computational and Data Sciences, Department of Mathematics": 1, "Department of Computer Science and Elec.
