I also recommend the accompanying workbook that provides step-to-step workout of odd-number questions, both can be obtained from the campus bookstore or online at www.amazon.com. Supplementary learning materials, such as journal articles and workout examples, will be distributed from time to time. You may also consult the following textbooks for further references. From a more theoretical side, you may read Mas-Colell, Andreu, Whinston, Michael D., and Green, Jerry R. (1995), Microeconomic Theory, 1st Edition, Cambridge, UK: Oxford University Press (hereinto ““MWG““) if you are interested in technical proofs and model-building. A book that focuses on both theory and application which I recommend is Varian Hal R. (1992), Microeconomic Analysis, 3rd Edition, Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley ＆ Sons, Inc. From a more applied side, you may study Jehle, Geoffrey A. and Reny, Philip J.
