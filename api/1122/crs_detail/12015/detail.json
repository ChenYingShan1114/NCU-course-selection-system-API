The documentary The Celluloid Closet makes an equally broad claim that “Hollywood taught straight people what to think of gay people, and gay people what to think of themselves.” Feminist critics since Mulvey have gone on to consider the problem of female spectatorship and questioned the social construction of gender (masculinity as well as femininity), and LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) film historians have since asked what possibilities there are for queer and transgender identification and desire in cinema. This course provides an opportunity for discussion of these and related issues regarding “the politics of representation” in an atmosphere of free and open inquiry. The principle analytical tools will be drawn from the diverse interdisciplinary fields of cinema and media studies, cultural studies, gender studies, gay and lesbian studies, and queer theory.\n[see ee-class for weekly modules with films and readings]", "ch": "Feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey argued that there was a sexual division of labor in Classical Hollywood cinema with “Woman as Image, Man as Bearer of the Look.” Women were objectified by the “male gaze” in cinema, which catered to the visual pleasure of male audience members.
