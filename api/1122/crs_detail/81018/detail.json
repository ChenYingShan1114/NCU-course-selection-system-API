We discuss that American corporate law and Taiwan corporate law have their particular structures. Also, we’ll seek to understand how the separation of ownership and control produces agency costs, and other remedy ways such as fiduciary duties, shareholder litigation, voting, and appraisal rights. Moreover, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) is one of the most important issues that should be well addressed by modern corporations for enhancing sustainability. Maximizing stockholders’ welfare has traditionally been deemed as the primary purpose for a corporation, but pursuing such purpose may result in high external costs borne by stakeholders, causing many social and environmental problems such as pollution, climate change, and human capital issues, etc., Although many commentators opine that ESG helps corporations in terms of long-term profits, for business decision-makers facing the trend of ESG, how to balance ESG and corporations’ interests seems unclear due to the lack of consistent standards.", "ch": "The G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance help policymakers evaluate and improve the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for corporate governance, to support economic efficiency, sustainable growth, and financial stability.
