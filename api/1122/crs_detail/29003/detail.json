Variability of X-ray binaries provides us fruitful information to understand the properties of these sources, including the nature of compact object, accretion disk and close binary’s properties. The variability can be periodic, quasi-periodic or even aperiodic with time scale less than millisecond to thousands of days, about 12 order of magnitudes’ difference. The variation amplitude may be as small as a few percent to about a factor of thousands. Various time scales’ modulations allow us to study different part of a binary system.
