If you are NOT an English graduate student, you will not be able to enroll given the objectives of my course. This theory-based course concentrates on the notion of epistemic injustice which intersects conceptual matrices in epistemology, political and moral philosophy. Contemporary social epistemologists have turned their attention from ideal epistemic situations to quotidian contexts in which social identity and power play a significant role in the way we evaluate others’ statements and ours. Spaces of injustice where practical and theoretical knowledge is produced, disseminated, and assessed are not rare. This course seeks to provide students with philosophical tools to reflect on such spaces. To do so, we will examine two forms of epistemic injustice: testimonial and hermeneutical, both introduced by British philosopher Miranda Fricker in her 2007 monograph Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing. We will pay attention to what is characteristic of them, cases illustrating them, and references preceding and following M. Fricker’s introduction of the terms.", "ch": "Please refer to English version."}, "content": {"en": "ALL COURSE CONTENT WILL BE PROVIDED IN\nENGLISH.\nAll weekly sessions comprise (i) a lecturing part; and (ii) a\ndiscussion section.\nThis three-part course is motivated by the following\nquestions:\nIntroduction: What is ‘epistemic injustice’ within the area\nof social epistemology?\nSection 1: What is testimonial injustice?\nSection 2: What is hermeneutical injustice?", "ch": "Please refer to English version."}, "textbook": {"en": "A copy of the course material will be ready on February 19.
