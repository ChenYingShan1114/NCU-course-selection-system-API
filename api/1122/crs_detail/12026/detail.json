In the first, assignments are textbook readings on structure and research methodology for academic essays in humanities, and we will discuss these assignments by analyzing sample student papers. Each week, students will be asked to write a short analysis of the structure and argumentation of a sample paper according to its use of one or more of the techniques introduced in the textbooks. During the second part of the course, our meetings will be conducted as workshop seminars also led by the students.\nThe choice of paper for the workshop is basically a paper from a previous class (approximately 10 pages long and incorporating some secondary\nsources). If you don‘t already have a paper that meets all these requirements, you should write one during the first few weeks of class.", "ch": "本課程將分為兩大部份。第一部份為培養學生寫作與作研究的能力，第二部份則為寫作工作坊。工作坊的論文，建議使用一篇之前已完成之十頁左右之報告，若沒有合適長度之報告，亦可於學期前幾週內完成一篇。"}, "textbook": {"en": "A reader will be provided", "ch": "自編教材"}, "self_comp": {"en": "100%", "ch": "100%"}, "method": {"en": "Lecture Seminar Individual Instruction Others", "ch": "講授 研討 個別指導 其他"}, "grading": {"en": "1.
