Predicting the orbital state of a satellite and how it varies with time is critical both in the case of spacecraft operations, as well as understanding the motion of natural celestial objects such as moons, planets, comets, and asteroids. In this class, we will introduce the fundamental concepts of astrodynamics as applied to the problem of orbit prediction and propagation, as well as its applications to spacecraft and satellite mission design applications. Students will learn how an orbit can be quantified and propagated using Keplerian orbit elements, as well as more advanced techniques accounting for orbit perturbations. The objective is for the student to develop a solid understanding of orbital mechanics and its applications.", "ch": "天體的位置及速度統一稱為軌道狀態。衛星軌道狀態的量化、預測與推算對人造衛星作業及瞭解自然天體（如：衛星、行星、彗星、小行星）運動扮演極重要的角色。 本課程將介紹現代軌道運動學基礎概念，以及其對軌道預測、推算、衛星任務設計的應用。選生將學習如何以克卜勒軌道參數量化及推算衛星軌道狀態。另外也將學習如何以數值積分法量化軌道擾動的影響。"}, "content": {"en": "This class will cover the following main points:\n- Coordinate and Time Systems\n- Two Body Problem\n- Kepler’s Equation, Two Body Propagation, Orbit Determination\n- Orbit Maneuvers\n- Orbit Perturbations and Effects\n- Numerical Propagation\nPrerequisites include successful completion of classical mechanics (or equivalent), as well as a course in programming with Matlab or Python (Matlab preferred).“", "ch": "本課程的重點如下：\n- 時間、空間座標\n- 二體問題\n- 克卜勒方程式、二體軌道推算、定軌\n- 軌道變更\n- 軌道擾動\n- 數值積分推算\n必修條件：力學、Matlab或Python程式設計語言（本課將以Matlab為主）。"}, "textbook": {"en": "Vallado, David A., Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications, Hawthorne, CA : Microcosm Press ; New York : Springer, c2007.", "ch": "Vallado, David A., Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications, Hawthorne, CA : Microcosm Press ; New York : Springer, c2007."}, "self_comp": {"en": "20", "ch": "20"}, "method": {"en": "Lecture Others", "ch": "講授 其他"}, "grading": {"en": "Homework ＆ Programming Assignments: 60％ Midterm: 20％ Final: 20％“", "ch": "作業、數值實驗、程式撰寫：60％ 期中考：20％ 期末考：20％“"}, "office_hr": {"en": "Wednesday, 1000-1200, S4-806, or by appointment.", "ch": "星期三，1000-1200, S4-806，或個別約定。"}, "teach_week": {"en": "18", "ch": "18"}, "flex_desc": {"en": "", "ch": ""}, "domain": {"en": "高層大氣科學與電離層物理 、 太空酬載", "ch": "高層大氣科學與電離層物理 、 太空酬載"}, "map": {"en": [{"competency": "Buildup of Space science knowledge", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Test/Exam ， Assignments ， Practices/Experiments"}, {"competency": "Cultivation of Solar-Terrestrial observation technology", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Test/Exam ， Assignments ， Practices/Experiments"}, {"competency": "Integration of innovation and critical thinking", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Assignments ， Practices/Experiments"}, {"competency": "Ability acquirement of data analysis", "rate": "(3) Medium", "Assessments": "Assignments ， Practices/Experiments"}, {"competency": "Buildup and Application of numerical models", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Assignments ， Practices/Experiments"}, {"competency": "Presentation and expression of research results", "rate": "(3) Medium", "Assessments": "Assignments ， Practices/Experiments"}, {"competency": "Ability acquirement of interdisciplinary cooperation and teamwork", "rate": "(2) Low", "Assessments": "No assessment"}], "ch": [{"competency": "太空科學知識的建立", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "紙筆測驗/會考 ， 作業練習 ， 實作/實驗"}, {"competency": "日地系統觀測技術的培養", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "紙筆測驗/會考 ， 作業練習 ， 實作/實驗"}, {"competency": "整合創新與獨立思考", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "作業練習 ， 實作/實驗"}, {"competency": "資料分析能力的養成", "rate": "(3) 普通", "Assessments": "作業練習 ， 實作/實驗"}, {"competency": "數值模式的建立與應用", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "作業練習 ， 實作/實驗"}, {"competency": "研究結果的表達及呈現", "rate": "(3) 普通", "Assessments": "作業練習 ， 實作/實驗"}, {"competency": "跨領域與團隊合作的能力", "rate": "(2) 低", "Assessments": "無"}]}, "asign_crite": {"en": ["Specific Subject Requirements:Prerequisite Course RequirementAP2015、Prerequisite Course RequirementAP2016、Prerequisite Course RequirementAP2051 only."], "ch": ["指定課程:必須先修AP2015、先修AP2016、先修AP2051。"]}, "prelim_sel": 0, "gender": {"male": 0, "female": 0}, "stu_depart": {"en": {}, "ch": {}}, "stu_grade": {"Bachelor": {}, "Master": {}, "Doctor": {}}}
