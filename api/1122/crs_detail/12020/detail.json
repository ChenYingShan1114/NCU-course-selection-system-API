We will examine a wide variety of novels (and some film adaptations), analyzing how their narrative form enables the construction of stories that reflect on and reinforce the development of middle-class values. In other words, we will consider how novels shape ostensibly progressive notions such as romantic individualism and female autonomy, as well as how they collude with repressive (sexual) mores, capitalist ideologies, and empire-building. Adopting a roughly chronological order, we will go over the Romantic, Victorian, and Modernist periods. Special emphasis will be placed on the way aesthetic forms are treated as means to carry out ethical practices that are not necessarily fully intentional. By closely engaging with the ambivalence or conflicts surrounding these aesthetic/ethical projects, students are expected to develop a more critical and historical understanding of the rise of English literary culture on the global stage and how it has shaped what are now understood to be Western values.", "ch": "This course introduces students to the rise of the English novel, which is roughly coeval with the rise of the British colonial empire, industrial capitalism, and the middle class.
