Students come from various departments across the school. In order to reduce students’ thresholds and fears for cross-domain learning, the course not only invites professional professionals In addition to the participation of teachers, more than three teaching assistants are also used to increase student interaction and control of learning progress. The first four weeks of the course are mainly about establishing basic concepts, innovative thinking, and team formation. The middle stage of the course focuses on planning proposals, and there are about 8 weeks in the later stage for students to participate in implementation and field testing. The technical main focus of this course is AIoT (Artificial Intelligence Internet of Things). Our commonly used sensors include temperature and humidity, air quality, magnetic valves, GPS, vibration, etc., all of which have the opportunity to be integrated into students‘ practical works and implemented in In the field of smart campus. The entire course emphasizes group teamwork, focusing on different topics, completing implementation and field verification. Participating students can fully experience the entire set of AIoT technical processes and practical applications, learn from the problems, and ensure a deep impression. This course encourages students to participate in competitions inside and outside the school, and at the same time introduces the resources of the Industry-Academic Operations Center. At the end of the semester, students can often produce a professional project and match it with the output of actual works, hoping to give students a sense of accomplishment. learning process.", "ch": "智慧校園實作是一門以動手實作、創新實踐的課程，強調跨域學習能力培養，學生來自於全校各個科系，課程為了減少學生對於跨域學習的門檻與恐懼，除了邀請專業的業師參與外，還採用三位以上的教學助教，以增加學生互動及學習進度掌握。課程前4週主要為建立基礎概念、創新思維、團隊形成。課程中期著重於企劃提案，後期大約有8週的時間讓學生參與實作與場域實測。本課程的技術主軸為AIoT(人工智慧物聯網)，我們常用的感測器有溫溼度、空氣品質、磁力閥、GPS、震動等，皆有機會整合到學生實作的作品上，並實現在智慧校園的場域中。整個課程強調小組團隊合作，針對不同的主題，完成實作及場域驗證，參與的同學可以完整體驗到整套AIoT的技術流程與實務應用，從問題中學習，保證印象深刻。本課程鼓勵學生參加校內外的競賽，同時導入產學營運中心的資源，期末成果發表學生往往可成產出一個專業的企劃案，並搭配實際作品的產出，期望帶給學生有成就感的學習歷程。"}, "textbook": {"en": "Self-edited teaching materials", "ch": "自編教材"}, "self_comp": {"en": "100", "ch": "100"}, "method": {"en": "Lecture", "ch": "講授"}, "grading": {"en": "Class performance and attendance 10％; Team performance 20％; Homework 10％; Midterm report 20％; Final results and report (including reflection) 40％", "ch": "課堂表現與出席10％; 團隊表現20％； 作業10％； 期中報告20％； 期末成果與結報(含反思)40％"}, "office_hr": {"en": "after class", "ch": "課後"}, "teach_week": {"en": "17+1", "ch": "17+1"}, "flex_desc": {"en": "Time required for completion of work", "ch": "作品完成的彈實時間"}, "domain": {"en": "跨域知識技能課群", "ch": "跨域知識技能課群"}, "map": {"en": [{"competency": "Scientific Spirit", "rate": "(1) Very Low", "Assessments": "Assignments"}, {"competency": "Logical Thinking", "rate": "(4) High", "Assessments": "Practices/Experiments"}, {"competency": "Professional Knowledge", "rate": "(4) High", "Assessments": "Practices/Experiments"}, {"competency": "Practical Application", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Practices/Experiments ， Products/Creative Performance"}, {"competency": "Teamwork", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Practices/Experiments"}, {"competency": "Global Vision", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Practices/Experiments ， Products/Creative Performance"}], "ch": [{"competency": "科學涵養", "rate": "(1) 非常低", "Assessments": "作業練習"}, {"competency": "邏輯思辨", "rate": "(4) 高", "Assessments": "實作/實驗"}, {"competency": "專業知識", "rate": "(4) 高", "Assessments": "實作/實驗"}, {"competency": "實務應用", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "實作/實驗 ， 作品/創作展演"}, {"competency": "團隊合作", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 實作/實驗"}, {"competency": "國際視野", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 實作/實驗 ， 作品/創作展演"}]}, "asign_crite": {"en": ["Type:Undergraduate Program only.Faculty:College of Earth Sciences only.", "Type:Undergraduate Program only.Faculty:College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science only."], "ch": ["學制:限學士班。學院:限地科學院。", "學制:限學士班。學院:限資電學院。"]}, "prelim_sel": 3, "gender": {"male": 2, "female": 1}, "stu_depart": {"en": {"Department of Geophysics": 1, "Department of Space Science and Engineering": 1, "Interdisciplinary Program of Earth System Science": 1}, "ch": {"地球科學學系": 1, "太空科學與工程學系": 1, "地球科學學院學士班": 1}}, "stu_grade": {"Bachelor": {"4": 1, "2": 1, "1": 1}, "Master": {}, "Doctor": {}}}
