In addition to a better understanding in the scheduling problems occurred in semiconductor manufacturing, this course also aims to lift student’s knowledge on algorithmic design/analysis and skill in Python coding. A student who plans to take this course should be interested in the scheduling research and be able to identify the mostly relevant literature for his/her topic of interest. In this class we will go through related literature for those topics of interest. Each student will be responsible to share his/her related literature and the ideas of how to adopt or modify the existing theory/algorithm for the problem solving. Students taken this class will need to read a bundle of papers and participate the class discussion. This class is also a platform for students to share their data structure and algorithmic approach in problem solving. Each student will learn how to design an algorithm and justify the performance by either the complexity analysis or the numeric analysis. As per the complexity analysis, the student needs to provide a formal proof. As per the numeric analysis, the student needs to implement his/her algorithm and conduct experiments for data collection. This course will be lectured in English. The pre-requisite for this course is IA 5051(Planning and Scheduling). Students with enough training in algorithmic approach and experience in Python are also welcome. A student who is not sure if he/she has enough background for this class should consult with the course instructor.", "ch": "This course is to prepare advanced students in Institute of Industrial Management (IM) for the research in the area of semiconductor manufacturing scheduling.
