We will discuss key concepts and methods in public economics, as well as communicate policy-relevant research findings. This course focuses on tax policy analysis, with a particular emphasis on determining and evaluating the impact of various taxes on individuals, enterprises, and their decisions. Furthermore, it addresses both the efficiency costs of taxation and the distributional impact of taxes.", "ch": "本課程旨在培養學生了解並閱讀公共經濟學的當前學術文獻的能力，並評估這些內容可如何應用於政策分析上。我們將討論公共經濟學的關鍵概念和方法，並介紹與政策相關的研究結果。本課程側重於租稅政策分析，並評估各種租稅工具對個人與企業決策的效果。此外，本課程亦會討論租稅效率成本以及租稅帶來的分配影響。"}, "content": {"en": "1.
