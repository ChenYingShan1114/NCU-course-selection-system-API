Through the aforementioned design thinking, Hakura resource investigation and knowledge base construction, and the training and training of programming courses, students will be able to develop localized based on the results of the Hakka language digital teaching material project, and we started to design and implement the project. We used this to test the effectiveness of the students studying in this micro-learning course. In this course, experts or professional teachers inside and outside the school will be hired to assist students in planning projects in the early part of the semester, and they will give comments at the end of the semester. When the course is in progress in the latter part of the semester, the teachers will not actively provide technical guidance but only provide suggestions and suggestions for ideas. Relevant resources give students more room to play, with students as the main body to solve problems and teachers and industry teachers as the role of consultation. The evaluation is based on the weight of the core competencies related to this course. In addition to the teacher's grade-by-item, peer-to-peer evaluation and learner selection also increase the interaction between knowledge producers and their peers and learners.
