As Arthurian literature (sometimes known as ‘Arthuriana’) remains a trans-European phenomenon, we will incorporate many texts outside of the Anglophone world in translation, and the chosen texts are roughly grouped under three linguistic headings: the Latin tradition (Geoffrey of Monmouth), the French tradition (Beroul and Chrétien de Troyes), and the English tradition (Marie de France, Chaucer, and Malory). By reading these texts, students are expected to not only gain a more diverse, comprehensive understanding of the changing nature of Arthurian legends, but also develop a critical sense of individual texts pertaining to their historical backgrounds and contexts. In addition, in order to frame Arthurian literature according to our modern concerns, we will spend a certain amount of time investigating themes pertaining to cultural colonialism, gender, emotion studies, and reception studies.
