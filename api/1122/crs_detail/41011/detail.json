Using the introductory cases (module one), the course firstly identifies the concept of data, information and knowledge, and then highlights the idea that the application of IT in the enterprise should well consider the alignment of technology, business strategy and organization (module two). The course introduces the emerging IT infrastructure and database systems. In it, several different data-models will be presented, and the topics refer to Data-Warehouse, Big-Data will be introduced. Again, the software ORACLE, SAP-HANA, IBM-Bluemix for the data resources management in the business will be introduced (module three and four). Based on the database systems, the information systems in the enterprise will be introduced in the module five. In it, the Transaction Processing Systems (TPS), Process-control systems, Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), MRP, MRP-II, manufacturing information systems, Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM), functional business systems in terms of accounting, human resources management, product development management, marketing management systems, etc. will be presented. Regarding the E-Business systems, the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Supply Chains Management (SCM) systems, as well as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems will be introduced based on the SAP software. Plus, the E-Commerce systems will be introduced in terms of business model and success factors and development of web-based marketplace. (module six and seven) Decision Support Systems (DSS), Executive Information Systems (EIS) and Knowledge Management (KM) systems will be presented in the module eight. The application of some up-to-dated intelligent methods will be discussed. The module nine introduces the methodology for building information systems in the enterprise. In the final module, we will discuss the Industrie 4.0 based on the theories of management information systems. Progress in this course is application-oriented. Each course unit is accompanied by at least one case analysis or reading/discussion assignment. The concepts, frameworks and methods used in management information systems are first introduced, and are then the application to the industries are discussed.\"", "ch": "介紹管理資訊系統的基本理論"}, "content": {"en": "\"I.
