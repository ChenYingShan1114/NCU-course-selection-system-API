OB is the study of how individuals and groups impact the behavior within an organization. Because organizations are an integral part of many people’s lives and as a member of organizations, you will encounter issues ranging from the individual level to the group level and the organizational level, and you will need to be aware of how these areas fit into your working life. You will learn in great detail, topics regarding individual behavior such as individual differences and motivation. Topics regarding group behavior include teams and leadership, as well as organizational level topics such as organizational culture.\nThroughout the course, I strongly encourage you to think of yourself not only as a hardworking student in this course, but also as a “future leader” in an organization (e.g., job, school, cultural, religious or sport) that you are currently associated with or planning to join after graduation. This will allow you to think critically about the information presented in classes. In other words, try putting yourself in the situation and connect what you learned with materials from other core Finance courses.", "ch": "A happy environment leads to better and memorable learning outcomes!\nThis course aims to create a happy environment to provide you with a comprehensive introduction to the wide range of theory, research, and practice in the field organizational behavior (OB).
