With global temperature showing an undisputable rising trend, a huge volume of ice and glaciers has melted, raising the sea level high enough to cause flooding in coastal cities. For some island countries, the government must seek home for some of their citizens at a higher place or in a different country. And Indonesia is even being forced to move its capital to another city. Climate change has also affected water supply and crop cultivation quite significantly for some regions. And the current animal/plant extinction rate is just unprecedented in the entire history of the Earth. To turn the tide against the increasingly severe climate change and global warming, virtually all countries have acted by making various efforts to regulate their economic activities, from raw material excavation to production, logistics, warehousing, and finally, recycling. Firms have started to pay great attentions to their energy consumption and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. A number of policies, regulations, acts, and agreements, including ErP, RoHS, REACH, WEEE, and the Paris Agreement, were made and enforced to hopefully strike a good balance between the triple bottom line: economy, environment, and society. Obviously, sustainability has been the world’s most important development policy! Human civilization cannot thrive without a stable energy supply. To limit the rise of global average temperature to 2.0°C at most (and to 1.5°C if possible) before the end of this century, we must replace the consumption of all fossil fuels with renewable energy in the next few decades. The ultimate goal is to emit no greenhouse gases ASAP. However, renewables such as solar and wind cannot provide a stable energy supply. Moreover, the type of electricity that they generate is direct current and often, such energy is produced in small volumes across a very big area. How to make efficient use of these renewables thus present a major challenge even to those leading countries.", "ch": "相對於地球自然演化的速度，人類正以飛快步伐改變全球樣貌，造成了溫度上升，氣候劇烈變化，以及環境嚴重汙染。某些島嶼型國家因海平面上升，淹沒其國土，必需將部份人民遷往高處，甚至是送往他國（例如斯里蘭卡）。而印尼已決定將其首都遷移至另一都市。在世界某些區域，氣候變遷已明顯對其糧食、飲用水等民生必需品造成影響。而目前全球物種滅絕的速度，更是史無前例。 有鑑於全球環境因人類過去種種不當作為而面臨嚴峻挑戰，世界各國已採取必要措施，針對能源使用、溫室氣體（greenhouse gases）排放、原物料及零組件來源、產品生產及使用過程等，訂定相關策略及法規（例如The Paris Agreement、ErP、RoHS、REACH、WEEE等），以同時兼顧經濟、社會與環境之均衡發展。永續發展（sustainable development)已成為世界各國至關重要之發展方針！ 人類文明仰賴穩定的能源來發展。為有效抑制全球暖化（global warming），使全球平均溫度上升幅度於本世紀末能夠低於2.0°C，甚至是低於1.5°C，各國必需於未來數十年間，廣泛以再生能源（renewable energy）來替換傳統石化能源，以大幅降低溫室氣體（greenhouse gases）排放。但再生能源多半無法持續供電（例如太陽能及風能），生產方式為分散式，所生電力又為直流電，因此如何激勵大眾及私人企業投資，以及如何將再生電力匯聚傳輸以進行有效運用，對各國政府均是重大挑戰。"}, "content": {"en": "The following outlines the topics to be covered in this course:\n1. climate change and global warming\n2. sustainability and corporate social responsibility\n3. renewable energy and energy storage technology\n4. solar and wind energy\n5. renewable energy planning\n6. electric vehicles and the electrification of road transport", "ch": "本課程將聚焦下列議題，以引領修課同學進入再生能源與永續發展領域。\n1. 氣候變遷與全球暖化\n2. 永續發展與企業社會責任\n3. 再生能源與儲能科技\n4. 太陽能與風能\n5. 再生能源規劃\n6. 電動車與運輸電氣化"}, "textbook": {"en": "All teaching materials are edited by the instructor.", "ch": "由任課教師編輯授課內容"}, "self_comp": {"en": "100", "ch": "100"}, "method": {"en": "Lecture Individual Instruction Others", "ch": "講授 個別指導 其他"}, "grading": {"en": "semester team project with two presentations (50% E.A.)", "ch": "學期專題；兩次報告 (各 50%)"}, "office_hr": {"en": "Thursday afternoon 2:00~4:00 (The 2nd Building of SoM; room 733-1)", "ch": "週四下午 2:00~4:00 (管二館 733-1)"}, "teach_week": {"en": "18", "ch": "18"}, "flex_desc": {"en": "", "ch": ""}, "domain": {"en": "", "ch": ""}, "map": {"en": [{"competency": "Management Knowledge", "rate": "(4) High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Research Report(printed on paper)"}, {"competency": "Critical Thinking and Problem-solving", "rate": "(4) High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Research Report(printed on paper)"}, {"competency": "Global Perspective", "rate": "(4) High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Research Report(printed on paper)"}, {"competency": "Social Responsibility", "rate": "(4) High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Research Report(printed on paper)"}, {"competency": "Communication Skill", "rate": "(2) Low", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Research Report(printed on paper)"}], "ch": [{"competency": "管理知識", "rate": "(4) 高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 專題研究報告(書面)"}, {"competency": "獨立思考和解決問題能力", "rate": "(4) 高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 專題研究報告(書面)"}, {"competency": "國際觀", "rate": "(4) 高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 專題研究報告(書面)"}, {"competency": "社會責任", "rate": "(4) 高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 專題研究報告(書面)"}, {"competency": "溝通能力", "rate": "(2) 低", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 專題研究報告(書面)"}]}, "asign_crite": {"en": ["Department:International Master of Business Administration program only.Year:First Year only.", "Department:International Master of Business Administration program only."], "ch": ["系所:限國際經營管理碩士學位學程。年級:限一年級。", "系所:限國際經營管理碩士學位學程。"]}, "prelim_sel": 12, "gender": {"male": 3, "female": 9}, "stu_depart": {"en": {"International Master of Business Administration program": 12}, "ch": {"國際經營管理碩士學位學程": 12}}, "stu_grade": {"Bachelor": {}, "Master": {"2": 1, "1": 11}, "Doctor": {}}}
