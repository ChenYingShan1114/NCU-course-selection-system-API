However, students can also take the class for one semester.\nOne solar event will be chosen as the topic of the class. The class will consist of Lecture, Preparation and Research.\nLecture: I plan to give the following lectures:\n1. An introduction about solar structure from the core to the corona\n2. An introduction about different techniques and instruments of the solar observation\n3. The properties and physics of the chosen solar event or phenomena\n4. IDL and Linux\n5. Data downloading and processing procedures\n6. Analysis methods\nPreparation (approximately 2 months)\nstudents are expected to do the following:\n1. Using various solar website to learn about the observational instruments and the chosen solar event\n2. Weekly reading and discussion of selected research journal papers\n3. Learning IDL and Linux\n4. Downloading and processing solar data\nResearch:\nStudents begin to apply different analysis method to the data, and use their physics and math knowledge to understand the results.", "ch": "本課程是設計為1年的課程。但學生也可只修一個學期。\n每年，一個太陽事件/現象將被選擇作為主題。該課程將包括授課，準備和研究三個部分:\n授課：\n1.
