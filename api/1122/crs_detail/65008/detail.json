Two aims are addressed in this course. First, a holistic view on all facets of fault, with a focus on faulting processes and the associated textures. Second, this course presents a multidisciplinary approach that unites the different sub-disciplines that are concerned with faults. This course uses text-books and research article to make student familiar with fault-zone geology. Therefore, all students are required to read text books and articles and share their point of view on the studied materials every week.", "ch": "這是一門展示累積多年的斷層研究的課程，而且將說明當前被廣泛接受的斷層地質概念與研究。這門課有兩個重點。第一，全面檢視斷層的各個面向，並將著重在斷層作用與伴隨之微構造。第二，這門課展示多學科對斷層的研究。這門課使用教科書與科學文章為教材讓學生熟悉斷層地質學。因此，每周學生將需要研讀書籍與文章，並且分享與討論該閱讀材料之內容。"}, "content": {"en": "Week 1: introduction\nWeek 2: earthquake engine (fault)\nWeek 3: understanding faults: chapter 2: fault mechanics and earthquakes\nWeek 4: understanding faults: chapter 5: faulting in the laboratory\nWeek 5: understanding faults: chapter 8: fault sealing\nWeek 6: fault-related paper: Fossen 2017: shear zones\nWeek 7: fault-related paper: Faulkner 2010: fault development\nWeek 8: fault-related paper: Choi 2016: fault damage zone\nWeek 9: fault-related paper: Anders 2014: microfractures\nWeek 10: fault-related paper: Brodsky 2019: the state of stress\nWeek 11: fault-related paper: Niemeijer 2012: earthquake physics\nWeek 12: fault-related paper: Di Toro 2011: fault lubrication\nWeek 13: fault-related paper: Rowe 2015: faults preserve records?\nWeek 14: fault-related paper: Piane 2017: carbonate fault rock\nWeek 15: fault-related paper: Cao 2019: graphitic materials in fault zones\nWeek 16: fault-related paper: Kuo 2014, 2017, 2018: graphitization in the active fault\nWeek 17: fault-related paper: Kuo 2009, 2011, 2014, 2015: frictional heating on clay gouge\nWeek 18: fault-related paper: Bebout 2016: fluid and mass transfer", "ch": "-Week 1: introduction\nWeek 2: earthquake engine (fault)\nWeek 3: understanding faults: chapter 2: fault mechanics and earthquakes\nWeek 4: understanding faults: chapter 5: faulting in the laboratory\nWeek 5: understanding faults: chapter 8: fault sealing\nWeek 6: fault-related paper: Fossen 2017: shear zones\nWeek 7: fault-related paper: Faulkner 2010: fault development\nWeek 8: fault-related paper: Choi 2016: fault damage zone\nWeek 9: fault-related paper: Anders 2014: microfractures\nWeek 10: fault-related paper: Brodsky 2019: the state of stress\nWeek 11: fault-related paper: Niemeijer 2012: earthquake physics\nWeek 12: fault-related paper: Di Toro 2011: fault lubrication\nWeek 13: fault-related paper: Rowe 2015: faults preserve records?\nWeek 14: fault-related paper: Piane 2017: carbonate fault rock\nWeek 15: fault-related paper: Cao 2019: graphitic materials in fault zones\nWeek 16: fault-related paper: Kuo 2014, 2017, 2018: graphitization in the active fault\nWeek 17: fault-related paper: Kuo 2009, 2011, 2014, 2015: frictional heating on clay gouge\nWeek 18: fault-related paper: Bebout 2016: fluid and mass transfer\n實際內容依課堂公告說明"}, "textbook": {"en": "1.
