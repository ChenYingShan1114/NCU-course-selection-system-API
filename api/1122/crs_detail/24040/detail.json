To better understanding the newest and advanced theory and diagnosis as well as treatment strategies, this course will be set as seminar through highly active discussion on high-impact publication. Student will be required to present three times throughout the course. The presentation is also a good training for student in public speaking. A good presentation does not only rely on scientific knowledge, also an excellent presentation skill. How to convey an informative but simplest science idea and/or result to both lay people and professional experts is challenge. Each presentation, student will get feedback on their science as well as overall presentation including presentation skills, power point organization. At the end of the semester, student will have deep understanding on neuropathology of neuropsychiatric disorder, also be confident to speak their research in public.\"", "ch": "此課程探討神經精神疾病的機制，利用最新的期刊論文來了解當前疾病的機制及治療方法。"}, "content": {"en": "\"Week Topic\n1 What is neuropsychiatric disorder?\n2 Paper presentation by Dr. Chia-Y Huang\n3 Special topic in Schizophrenia-I\n4 Special topic in Schizophrenia -II\n5 Special topic in Autism\n6 Special topic in bipolar disorder\n7 Special topic in Addiction\n8 Special topic in Post-traumatic stress disorder\n9 Special topic in Chronic stress\n10 Special topic in Social stress\n11 Special topic in Depression\n12 Special topic in Learning and Memory\n13 Special topic in Fear memory-I\n14 Special topic in Fear memory-II\n15 Special topic in Decision making\n16 Special topic in Motivation\n17 Special topic in Sleep\n18 Discussion\"", "ch": "Week Topic\n1 What is neuropsychiatric disorder? 什麼是神經精神疾病\n2 Paper presentation by Dr. Chia-Y Huang 黃佳瑜報告\n3 Special topic in Schizophrenia-I 思覺失調症I\n4 Special topic in Schizophrenia -II 思覺失調症II\n5 Special topic in Autism 自閉症\n6 Special topic in bipolar disorder 躁鬱症\n7 Special topic in Addiction 成癮症\n8 Special topic in Post-traumatic stress disorder創傷症候群\n9 Special topic in Chronic stress慢性壓力\n10 Special topic in Social stress社交壓力\n11 Special topic in Depression憂鬱症\n12 Special topic in Learning and Memory學習與記憶\n13 Special topic in Fear memory-I恐懼記憶I\n14 Special topic in Fear memory-II恐懼記憶II\n15 Special topic in Decision making 決定力\n16 Special topic in Motivation動機\n17 Special topic in Sleep睡眠\n18 Discussion討論"}, "textbook": {"en": "\"References: 1.
