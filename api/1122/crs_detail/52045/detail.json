We will discuss their origins, applications, merits, as well as demerits from the viewpoint of functionality and code modularity. Some relevant design patterns will also be mentioned and compared. Since these topics are hardly mentioned in existing textbooks, we will use our slides as the teaching materials. This year we will have many exercises for you to program in the classroom, so you will need to bring your laptop in these weeks.", "ch": "這門課會從講解程式語言中的構成要素開始，討論許多程式設計典範以及支援它們的程式語言結構。我們會從功能性與程式碼模組性的觀點，來談它們的起源、應用、優點與缺陷。也會提及數個極為相關的程式設計模式，對其進行比較。由於這些議題較少出現於既有的教科書，我們會以自行編寫的投影片作為教材。今年我們也會在課堂時間內安排幾個程式練習，因此在這幾週裡將需要自行準備筆電參與。"}, "textbook": {"en": "n/a", "ch": "無"}, "self_comp": {"en": "100", "ch": "100"}, "method": {"en": "", "ch": ""}, "grading": {"en": "Attendance 30%, Exercise 40%, Final Project 30%", "ch": "出席30%、隨堂練習40%、期末專題30%"}, "office_hr": {"en": "by appointment", "ch": "另行約定"}, "teach_week": {"en": "16+2", "ch": "16+2"}, "flex_desc": {"en": "The last two weeks are for project Implementation and Q&A.", "ch": "留予課程總複習QA、期末專題實作輔導"}, "domain": {"en": "人工智慧、資料科學與多媒體研究群", "ch": "人工智慧、資料科學與多媒體研究群"}, "map": {"en": [], "ch": []}, "asign_crite": {"en": ["Department:MSc in Computer Science and Information Engineering、Institute of Software Engineering、Master‘s Program in Artificial Intelligence, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering、PhD in Computer Science and Information Engineering only.", "Department:Department of Computer Science and Elec.
