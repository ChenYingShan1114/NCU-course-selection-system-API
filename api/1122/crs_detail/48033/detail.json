The super computing power and big data open a variety of possibilities to shed new lights in rapid emerging fields like computer science, finance, marketing, social media, politics as well as general social and humanity sciences. This course aims to equip advanced undergraduate and graduate students with the understanding of the state-of-art modelling and algorithm knowledge of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the field of Finance and Economics. Given the structurally designed products, functioning mechanisms and contextual microstructure in Financial markets, we will see how these statistical learning and econometric toolboxes are infused with the financial theory to make the new paradigm shift in modern Finance in field of prediction/forecasting, investment, trading and risk management. Students are expected grasp and apply the discussed concepts and modelling techniques in a team project, turning in 2 exercises, attend the 2 exams, share reflections from the invited talk and field trip, present a team selected paper in the reading list; and present the joint team project with a paper version report in the final.
