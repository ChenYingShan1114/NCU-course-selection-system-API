This course would apply these on different taxa to synthesize how evolutionary events have driven the evolution of organisms’ distribution patterns, population structures, and speciation on global or local scales. The East and Southeast Asia encompasses one of the most actively geographical histories on earth with extremely high biodiversities. Conservation issues are highly emphasized and valued there. However, we are still limited in organism information from these areas.
