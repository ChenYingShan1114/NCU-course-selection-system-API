At the end of the course, students should understand the basic grammar structure, compose grammatically correct sentences, and identify different grammatical rules. The course will be fully student-centered and teacher-centered instruction. Moreover, This course is designed mainly for students to build a strong English base through an interactive learning environment. A mixture of both academic and daily English will be present. Furthermore, since scholars argue, the main purpose of language is to be able to communicate, task-based instruction and student centered instruction will be implemented—meaning, a lot of pair work, group work and interaction. Students will be asked to speak up because practice makes perfect.", "ch": "此課程規劃讓學員增進個人英文文法能力並達到學術水準。課程結束後學員應可以瞭解基本文法架構並實際的實用。此課會讓學員有分組互相教學的互動。同時真實生活語言會呈現在課堂裡。希望學員可以多發問以便學習。"}, "textbook": {"en": "The Grammar Rules of Thumb / ISBN: 978-986-84142-0-4", "ch": "英文法只是一些規則而已 / ISBN: 978-986-84142-0-4"}, "self_comp": {"en": "100", "ch": "100"}, "method": {"en": "Others", "ch": "其他"}, "grading": {"en": "Group Learning 35％ Homework 10％ Midterm Exam 20％ Final Exam 30％", "ch": "小組學習 35％ 回家功課 10％ 期中考試 25％ 期末考試 30％"}, "office_hr": {"en": "Monday 2:00-3:00P.M.; Wednesday1:00-3:00P.M.", "ch": "星期一2:00-3:00P.M.; 星期三1:00-3:00P.M."}, "teach_week": {"en": "16+2", "ch": "16+2"}, "flex_desc": {"en": "Final Assessment project", "ch": "期末評估"}, "domain": {"en": "基礎英文", "ch": "基礎英文"}, "map": {"en": [{"competency": "Language & Communication Skills", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Test/Exam ， Assignments ， Attendance/Performance ， Portfolios Assessment ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}, {"competency": "Intercultural Literacy", "rate": "(4) High", "Assessments": "Assignments ， Presentation/Oral Exam ， Attendance/Performance ， Portfolios Assessment ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}, {"competency": "Self-directed Lifelong Learning", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Test/Exam ， Assignments ， Attendance/Performance ， Portfolios Assessment ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}], "ch": [{"competency": "語言溝通", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "紙筆測驗/會考 ， 作業練習 ， 出席/課堂表現 ， 學習檔案評量 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}, {"competency": "文化視野", "rate": "(4) 高", "Assessments": "作業練習 ， 口頭報告/口試 ， 出席/課堂表現 ， 學習檔案評量 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}, {"competency": "自主學習", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "紙筆測驗/會考 ， 作業練習 ， 出席/課堂表現 ， 學習檔案評量 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}]}, "asign_crite": {"en": ["Type:Undergraduate Program only.Year:Fourth Year only.", "Type:Undergraduate Program only.Year:Third Year only.", "Type:Undergraduate Program only.Year:Second Year only."], "ch": ["學制:限學士班。年級:限四年級。", "學制:限學士班。年級:限三年級。", "學制:限學士班。年級:限二年級。"]}, "prelim_sel": 30, "gender": {"male": 16, "female": 14}, "stu_depart": {"en": {"Department of Computer Science and Elec.
