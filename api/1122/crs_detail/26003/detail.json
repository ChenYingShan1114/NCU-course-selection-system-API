Physicists of the time perceived the construction of the edifice named “Physics“ as complete, with the remaining task akin to adorning the rooms within the building to enhance its magnificence. Just when physicists believed that human understanding of physics had reached its pinnacle, with only the last two lingering clouds on the horizon, known as the “ether“ and blackbody radiation, yet to be resolved, these seemingly insignificant questions, upon closer scrutiny, expanded and ultimately overturned classical physics. This upheaval gave rise to modern physics, ushering in two fundamental theories that form the pillars supporting contemporary technology: relativity and quantum physics. In this course, we will emphasize the development of quantum physics, exploring its theoretical framework, physical significance, and associated practical challenges. Depending on the course progression, we may also provide a brief introduction to the theoretical principles of relativity. Ultimately, the goal is to provide students with a broad understanding of modern physics.", "ch": "在19世紀末，物理學在牛頓力學、電磁學與熱力學的堅定基礎下，幾乎所有物理現象都能在上述三個強大的理論中找到滿意的答案。當時的物理學家認為這棟名為＂物理＂的大廈已經建成，剩餘的工作就像是對大廈中的房間內作上精美的裝飾，使之變得更加華麗。正當物理學家認為人類對物理學的認識已到了盡頭，只剩下最後兩個被稱為物理界的兩多烏雲（乙太以及黑體輻射）尚未被解決時，這兩朵微不足道的問題被進一步挖掘後卻越長越大，最終顛覆了整個古典物理，並形成了近代物理學，進一步誕生了支撐現代科技的兩大理論：相對論與量子物理。 在本課程中，我們將著重在量子物理學的發展，探討其理論架構、物理意義與相關的實作問題。依照授課情況，我們也將簡介相對論之理論原理。最終使學生對近代物理學有一個大致的認識。"}, "content": {"en": "1.
