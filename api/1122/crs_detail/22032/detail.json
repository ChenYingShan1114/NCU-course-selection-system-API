The goal of the two year courses is to train the basic altitude, the methodology, the basic knowledge background of conducting experimental physics research. The former focuses on the self-learning, oral and written presentation, discussion and dialectics in the classroom. The latter focuses on the hand-on experiments in the laboratory. The basic methodology for experimental physics exploration will be emphasized and practiced. It includes: self- and group independent studies, systematic thinking and dialectics, oral and written presentations, team works and management, and manipulating tools such as electronics, computer, machine shop skills, English and mathematics, etc..“", "ch": "實驗方法課程與實驗物理課程為物理系學生學習實驗物理的相連貫的二基礎入門課程，共為期兩年。前者以課堂講授、發表、與討論為主，配合於後者在實驗室進行實驗系統建構與量測。課後進行分析與報告撰寫。以培養學生從事基礎實驗物理動手能力，與研究所需基本態度與方法學訓練為基礎理念。 將透過此二連貫課程，對學生進行實驗探索方法學的基礎訓練：如自我與團隊自主學習、系統思維與辯證、電子、機械、電腦、英文等實驗工具操控、口頭與書面論述、團隊合作等方法學鍛鍊。"}, "content": {"en": "“The first year course will be devoted to the learning, designing, and constructing of the analog (passive/active) electronics systems, digital electronics systems, computer programming, molecular dynamics simulation method, digital interface control, data analysis. Integrated systems will be built to conduct the experiment and data analysis. Students have to plan the details of the target, the method, the design, and the progress of their own experiment each week. Each later experiment should integrate the prior experiments. The above contents will be presented and discussed in the experimental method class, and conducted in the experimental physics class. In the second semester, each student has to find out a topic about the modern experimental technique and prepare the review talk about that topic given in the third semester.\nThe third semester will be devoted to leaning the mechanical design and machine shop manipulation, and how to construct an integrated physical system for exploring the assigned experimental subject. Students in each team have to design and construct their own torsional pendulum system, the electronic and imaging measurement systems, and the data analysis software. In the experimental method class, the design, the progress and the results will be presented and discussed. In the experimental physics class, the systems will be constructed and the experiment will be conducted. They also have to organize them-self into different teams to give a 40 minute review talk on the modern experimental technique. At the end of the third semester, each team has to do a literature search on a modern physics topic published in the past five years on the prestige journals such as Nature, Science, Physical Review Letters, etc; and prepare for the oral presentation to review the chosen subject for the next semester. In the fourth semester, each team has to propose and conduct their own new experiment extended from the review subject. In the experimental method class each week, they have to give progress report and discuss their finding and experimental obstacles. At the end of the semester, they have to make a poster, organize a mini-physics department annual meeting, and present their poster.“", "ch": "“大一第一學期講授類比電路基本概念，口頭與書面報告的方法，透過含 RC, RLC, Transistor, Operational amplifier等電子原件所構成的簡單系統進行實驗設計，於課堂討論辯證，利用實驗物理課程，由學生動手建立實驗系統，進行量測，並於課後分析及撰寫報告。實驗之細節項目及內容，進行進度，均由學生自訂之。第二學期則教授數位系統軟硬體基本理論，並進行電腦軟體撰寫，介面控制，類比-數位與數位- 類比轉換，數位資料分析，電腦分子動力模擬等實驗，及上述項目統整之自動數位量測與控制實驗系統建構，與實驗執行。第二學期期末指定數十現代物理實驗技術題目，要求學生於其中自選題目，於暑假期間進行第三學期口頭報告的文獻調查。第三學期課堂講授部分則由學生每人進行四十分鐘現代物理實驗技術，以英文為之。實驗部分則教授機械工廠諸工具機如銑床，車床，鑽床，鋸床等方法，並由學生操作之。而後指定學生數系統實驗題目，學生自行設計與架設系統，設定細部研究議題，進行數據量測分析，與書面及口頭報告。以期學生學習系統整合概念。第三學期寒假，學生須進行下學期自行設計實驗的準備，於第四學期初進行實驗計畫的口頭報告，並於第四學期以一學期的實驗時間完成之。第四學期的課堂講授部分，則由每一或二學生由物理最佳期刊如 Physical Review Letter 或 Nature, Science 等選擇一篇近年有趣的實驗論文進行報告，期望學生透過報告不僅瞭解現代實驗技術如何系統整合，並瞭解近代物理研究的不同方向。期末要求每一組學生就其實驗成果製作學術性壁報一份。“"}, "textbook": {"en": "None", "ch": "無"}, "self_comp": {"en": "80", "ch": "80"}, "method": {"en": "Lecture Seminar Practical Training Lab Individual Instruction Others", "ch": "講授 研討 實習/實驗 個別指導 其他"}, "grading": {"en": "Oral reports, Written reports", "ch": "口頭報告、書面報告"}, "office_hr": {"en": "10:00-12:00 Tuesday", "ch": "10:00-12:00 Tuesday"}, "teach_week": {"en": "18", "ch": "18"}, "flex_desc": {"en": "", "ch": ""}, "domain": {"en": "共同物理課程", "ch": "共同物理課程"}, "map": {"en": [{"competency": "Elementary physics", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Practices/Experiments ， Attendance/Performance ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}, {"competency": "Intermediate physics", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Practices/Experiments ， Attendance/Performance ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}, {"competency": "Logical thinking and independent thinking", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Practices/Experiments ， Attendance/Performance ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}, {"competency": "Team work", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Practices/Experiments ， Attendance/Performance ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}, {"competency": "Self-learning", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Practices/Experiments ， Attendance/Performance ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}, {"competency": "English", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Practices/Experiments ， Attendance/Performance ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}, {"competency": "Experimental skills", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Practices/Experiments ， Attendance/Performance ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}, {"competency": "Programming and computer skills", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Practices/Experiments ， Attendance/Performance ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}, {"competency": "Special topic execution", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Practices/Experiments ， Attendance/Performance ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}, {"competency": "Academic ethics", "rate": "(5) Very High", "Assessments": "Presentation/Oral Exam ， Practices/Experiments ， Attendance/Performance ， Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment"}], "ch": [{"competency": "基礎物理", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 實作/實驗 ， 出席/課堂表現 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}, {"competency": "進階物理", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 實作/實驗 ， 出席/課堂表現 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}, {"competency": "邏輯分析與獨立思考", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 實作/實驗 ， 出席/課堂表現 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}, {"competency": "團隊經營", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 實作/實驗 ， 出席/課堂表現 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}, {"competency": "自我學習能力", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 實作/實驗 ， 出席/課堂表現 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}, {"competency": "語文與論述能力", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 實作/實驗 ， 出席/課堂表現 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}, {"competency": "實驗能力", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 實作/實驗 ， 出席/課堂表現 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}, {"competency": "電腦應用與程式設計", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 實作/實驗 ， 出席/課堂表現 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}, {"competency": "專題計畫執行", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 實作/實驗 ， 出席/課堂表現 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}, {"competency": "學術倫理", "rate": "(5) 非常高", "Assessments": "口頭報告/口試 ， 實作/實驗 ， 出席/課堂表現 ， 自我評量/同儕互評"}]}, "asign_crite": {"en": [], "ch": []}, "prelim_sel": 0, "gender": {"male": 0, "female": 0}, "stu_depart": {"en": {}, "ch": {}}, "stu_grade": {"Bachelor": {}, "Master": {}, "Doctor": {}}}
