To develop the student’s capacity to formulate tractable research questions on\ninterdisciplinary problems or coherent set of questions that are interdisciplinary in\nnature, that is, questions which cannot be addressed optimally within the scope of\na single academic discipline\n2. To foster the student’s capacity to choose or develop a research design and\nmethod of investigation that suits the nature of the research question(s)\n3. To provide reflective experience in piloting the investigation or project, including\npractice in data analysis suitable to the research purposes and to the nature of the\ndata gathered\n4. To cultivate the student’s capacity to evaluate and adjust relevant aspects of the\nresearch process (the research questions, design, data, and data analyses)\naccording to what is learned from piloting an investigation"}, "outline": {"ch": ".", "en": "1 Introduction and overview of the course\n2 Motivating the research space (finding the research niche)\nSwales: Creating a Research Space (C.A.R.S.)\nChapter 1 Creswell 4th ed\n3 Refining the research questions Chapter 5 Cresswell 4th ed\n4 Matching methods to research questions: On quantitative\nmethods (I) Chapter 3, Creswell, sections on research questions for quantitative approaches\n5 Matching methods to research questions:  On quantitative methods (II)\nChapter 8, Creswell: quantitative research\nmethods.\n6 Student presentation: quantitative methods Assignment Due: Critical summary of\nquantitative research questions and methods\n7 Matching methods to research questions:  On qualitative methods (I)\nChapter 3, Creswell, sections on research questions for qualitative approaches\n4/5\n8 Matching methods to research questions:  On qualitative methods (II)\nChapter 9, Creswell: qualitative research methods\n9 Student presentation on qualitative methods Assignment Due: Critical summary of\nqualitative research methods\n10 Critical appraisal: Matching your research methods to your research questions\nReview of readings focused on individualized research design\n11 Student presentation on revised research questions Assignment Due: Revised research questions\n12 Piloting the research design (I) Assignment Due: Pilot study research design\n(draft)\n13 Piloting the research design (II) Assignment Due: Pilot study research design\n(revised)\n14 Modes of data analysis (I): Quantitative data analysis Modes of data analysis (I):\nQuantitative data analysis\n15 Modes of data analysis (II): Qualitative data analysis Chapter 9, Creswell, sections on qualitative data analysis\n16 Student presentation: sample\ndata analysis\nDue: Sample data analysis\n17 On writing up pilot study findings No readings assigned.
