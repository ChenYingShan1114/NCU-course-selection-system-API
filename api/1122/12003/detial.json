With a focus on providing our students with transferable skills of exposition, argumentation, and persuasion, the course teaches students to present their opinions in a logical form that actively engages with existing debates, discussions, and scholarship. Throughout the course, students will develop the ability to identify reliable sources, summarize and paraphrase others’ ideas, and use citations effectively to support their arguments and establish credibility in their writing. Students will also learn how to effectively integrate existing scholarship and ideas into their own arguments, using supporting evidence to demonstrate their understanding of a specific social or cultural issue. Served as the second course in the series of our writing classes, “Documentation and Argumentation” offers our students fundamental training in research, reasoning, and critical thinking that helps them present their ideas and thoughts with clarity, conciseness, and credibility.\nThis theory and practice-based course seeks to provide students with critical thinking skills and strategies to write, assess and reconstruct argumentative essays by focusing on the notions of argument, clarifying meaning, and fallacies. All skills will be reviewed in terms of its virtues and limitations. For the writing content, we will pay attention to cultural and social current controversies (course references will include text, visual and audio material).", "en": "*本課程為英文系大一語文訓練課程，修課人數上限為20人，並不開放外系選課，亦不額外發放選課密碼卡。\nThe course, “Documentation and Argumentatinn,” is designed to familiarize students with essential skills for crafting effective argumentative essays.
