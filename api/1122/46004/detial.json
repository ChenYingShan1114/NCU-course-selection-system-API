After these two simple assignments, two different sets of coding assignment will be given – one for scheduling coding track and another for data science coding track. For each coding assignment, this lab section will organize a discussion to assist students getting familiar with python and data structures for that assignment. Students will also be separated into two sub-sections for discussion – one for scheduling coding track and another one for data science coding track. These two sub-sections will be run in parallel. After this semester, students should know how to google possible coding answers over the Internet and have a limited coding experience which is required for the graduate study.\n\n1Course introduction (SAP / PyCharm installation)\nCoding project discussion 1: Project 1\n2Business Process Overview\nSystem-Wide Concepts\nCoding project discussion 2: Project 1\n \n3Manufacturing Planning and Execution\nSAP fundamental use\nCoding project discussion 3: Project 2\n4Material Master Data\nCoding project discussion 4: Project 2\n5Material Master Data\nCoding project discussion 5: Project 3\n6Bill of Material (BOM)\nCoding project discussion 6: Project 3\n7Bill of Material (BOM) \n8Work Center\n9Midterm exam \n10Routing\nCoding project discussion 7: Project 4\n11Routing\nCoding project discussion 8: Project 4\n12SOP\nCoding project discussion 9: Project 5\n13Planning strategies\nDemand Management\nCoding project discussion 10: Project 5\n14MRP\nCoding project discussion 11: Project 6\n15MRP \nCoding project discussion 12: Project 6\n16Production Order\n17Production Order\n18Role Playing Test/ Final exam", "en": "This course will teach PP module under SAP S/4 HANA.
