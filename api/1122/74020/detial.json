However, public administration (PA) has traditionally paid little attention to most science-related issues. One reason for this is the common belief that science, particularly “Science” or “hard-science,“ falls solely within the purview of scientists, leaving minimal relevance for PA perspectives. In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that science and technology play an essential role in almost all areas of decision/policy-making. \n\nThis course aims to deepen and broaden our understanding of science and technology as social activities. It seeks to explore significant theories within the STS framework. Throughout the course, we will endeavor to spotlight major concepts and literature from both PA and STS fields. By engaging with assigned readings, posing thought-provoking questions, and fostering discussions and debates, we hope to unveil a clearer relationship between these two fields. Consequently, a comprehensive view, i.e. “STS and Policy”, will serve as a guide for further research endeavors."}, "outline": {"ch": "-", "en": "Unit I: Introduction\n1. An introduction to STS\n2.
