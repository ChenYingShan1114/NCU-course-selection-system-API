Because organizations are an integral part of many people’s lives and as a member of organizations, you will encounter issues ranging from the individual level to the group level and the organizational level, and you will need to be aware of how these areas fit into your working life. You will learn in great detail, topics regarding individual behavior such as individual differences and motivation. Topics regarding group behavior include teams and leadership, as well as organizational level topics such as organizational culture.\nThroughout the course, I strongly encourage you to think of yourself not only as a hardworking student in this course, but also as a “future leader” in an organization (e.g., job, school, cultural, religious or sport) that you are currently associated with or planning to join after graduation. This will allow you to think critically about the information presented in classes.
