navigate and critically analyze the key aspects and developments in health and environment deterioration.\n(2) Module 2: Societal systems\n­Engage critically with the resilient urban system through the lens of living-space management.\n­Consider the interlinkages between different environmental compartments such as water, food, and energy from a management perspective.\n­Develop a critical understanding of the trajectories of the sustainable system for consumption and production.\n(3) Module 3: Environmental Governance\n­Understand environmental ethics that are re-shaping social and environmental relationships.\n­Integrate transition possible in each of the socio-technical frontiers of governance into policy analysis.\n­Learn and apply methods for risk assessment and integrate relevant natural science knowledge.\n­Apply methods, concepts, and frameworks to case study material on multiple conflicting interests between government and stakeholders.\n(4) Module 4: Integration and Methodology\n­Compare and critique frameworks for contextualizing transdisciplinary approaches that might drive and accelerate change towards sustainable development.\n­Acquire the ability to go from real-world problems with these features to possible solutions.", "en": "The course objectives are addressed through four core modules:\n(1) Module 1: Environment-Human interactions\n­Critically
