In brief, it provides a single unifying theory of Earth’s dynamics. Essentially every geological process about our planet is related either directly or indirectly to plate tectonics.

We then illustrate how geoscientists adopted the theory to investigate the dynamics of the Earth searching for a variety of questions or problems, for example the nature of the lithospheric plates, what causes them to move, how we measure the rates and direction of plate motion, how mountain ranges form and so on. We also introduce interactions between the geosphere and the hydrosphere and atmosphere during the Quaternary, which led to the formation of present landscapes and sedimentary environments. Concepts and methods will be introduced. Then cases studies, including the Taiwan mountain belt, will be presented to illustrate the dynamics at plate boundaries, from long-term geological processes (1-10 Ma) to on-going active deformation and the earthquake cycle.", "en": "In this course we introduce how the theory of plate tectonics developed and discuss the evidence upon which it is based.
