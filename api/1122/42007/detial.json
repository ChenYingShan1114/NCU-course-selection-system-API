OB is the study of how individuals and groups impact the behavior within an organization. Because organizations are an integral part of many people’s lives and as a member of organizations, you will encounter issues ranging from the individual level to the group level and the organizational level, and you will need to be aware of how these areas fit into your working life. You will learn in great detail, topics regarding individual behavior such as individual differences and motivation. Topics regarding group behavior include team characteristics and leadership, as well as organizational level topics such as organizational culture.\nThroughout the course, I strongly encourage you to think of yourself not only as a hardworking student in this course, but also as a “future leader” in an organization (e.g., job, school, cultural, religious or sport) that you are currently associated with or planning to join after graduation or as a “future OB scholar” who likes to apply OB knowledge to help solve actual problems in the organizations. This will allow you to think critically about the information presented in classes. Moreover, by putting yourself in the situation, you can develop one or even more research questions that you are most interested in. These research questions can then be developed into the topic of your thesis!\nCourse Delivery Format:\nThis course includes lectures, class discussions, article presentations on peer-reviewed and management magazine articles, and min-case studies. In the second week, you will be asked to form groups of 3-4. Your group will then be responsible to complete article presentations, as well as the final research presentation and written report.\nMy role as an instructor of the course will be introducing and reviewing the core OB concepts before and after the presentations, as well as, providing additional related materials. More importantly, I wish to stimulate class discussions. You are invited and rewarded to participate in class discussions by raising any related comments or asking questions. Remember that, your participation makes the entire course much more interesting and fun!
