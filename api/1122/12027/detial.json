This, of course, is not coincidental, for, like melancholia, shame is also considered by the Western philosophical tradition to be constitutive of subjectivity. Contemporary theorists like Silvan Tomkins and Eve Sedgwick, who had helped to shape current critical vocabulary on shame, are not exempt from this tradition. This seminar intends to reframe these Western theories of shame against the humanist premises presupposed by these discourses. During the first half of the semester, we will tease out these humanist premises in not only the “psychological” strands of theories like those promoted by Tomkins and Sedgwick, but also in thinkers putatively labelled as anti-humanist such as Deleuze and Massumi. Questions of ontology will arise as we tackle the ensuing controversies over biology and human intention. But insofar as ontologies are culture-specific, one might want to ask whether the model of affective subjectivities taken as a given in those Western theories also holds true for the East Asian context we find ourselves in. Our subsequent engagement with Benedict’s notion of shame culture might be helpful for a reconceptualization of shame not as an individual but rather as a cultural formation. As we approach the second half of the semester, we shall further interrogate shame as an aesthetic formation – also in a comparative context. Since this is an untrodden ground which has rarely been explored by current affect theory, we shall experiment our way out by engaging directly with literary and filmic texts East and West. It is our aim to flesh out an aesthetic theory of shame which is no longer preoccupied with the human face but rather with abject body parts such as the anus. By closely examining literary works by Henry James and Eileen Chang and films by Tsai Ming-liang and Wong Kar-wai, along with comparative critical works by Rey Chow, David Der-wei Wang, Ren-peng Liu and Naifei Ding, a more comprehensive understanding of shame will be hopefully reached with equal attention paid to its political, ontological and aesthetic aspects as well as their possible intersections.", "en": "Shame, like melancholia, is arguably one of the affects most frequently discussed in contemporary critical theory, queer theory, and affect studies.
