This subject is a one year course with two credits for each semester.  Interested students should have basic knowledge in Cell Biology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology, before they take this subject.   Students taking this subject will be introduced with the early development of four model animals, including fruit fly, zebra fish, nematode, and mouse/human.  Later in the second semester, the development of various organs in mammals and chicks will be discussed in detail.  The creation of organisms by the fertilization of sperms and eggs will also be discussed.  The application of these knowledge in biomedical research and clinical therapy will be discussed at the end of each chapter.  Apart from lectures in the classes in the classroom, students are also required to perform two experiments to observe the developments of C. elegans and chicks in the specified periods.“", "en": "“of four model animals, including fruit fly, zebra fish, nematode, and mouse/human.
