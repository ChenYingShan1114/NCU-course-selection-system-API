It covers the fundamental theory of microwave remote sensing, including the interaction of microwave radiation with different environmental components and the operation of various radiometer systems. The course is structured into several modules that address key areas such as the principles of microwave remote sensing, the contrast between active and passive sensing, and the practical applications of microwave observations for meteorological and environmental monitoring. Students will engage with advanced topics including passive microwave sensing for land surface modeling, atmospheric remote sensing techniques, and radio occultation methods for atmospheric and ionospheric studies. A significant component of the course involves hands-on applications, focusing on interpreting microwave imagery, modeling, and analyzing tropical cyclones. Emphasis is placed on problem-based learning to enhance students‘ practical skills in applying microwave remote sensing data to real-world challenges."}, "textbook": {"ch": "1.
