The course “Doing Astrophysics using\nPython“ is offered for satisfying both (1) students who is\nlooking for an opportunity of having practical computer\nprogramming training, and (2) students who is willing to learn\nintroductory astrophysics through hands-on sessions. Because\nPython is getting very popular nowadays, I choose Python as the\nmain programming language for the course. For this course, basic\nPython programming and basic visualisation techniques are\nreviewed at the beginning of the semester. Then, students will\nstart to work on the visualisation of astronomical objects and\nphenomena, such as visualisation of spectrum of a star,\nvisualisation of motion of planets, and locations of stars on the\nsky. Plots that we commonly see on textbooks are reproduced, and\nthose plots help students to understand underlying physics.\nSelf-compiled lecture note is offered by the instructor each\nweek. Also, a set of sample Python scripts are provided to\nstudents via a repository on GitHub. Students first download\nthose sample Python scripts, run those scripts, and see what\nhappens. Students will then modify a part of those sample scripts\nto understand more about Python programming. For executing Python\nscripts, we use Google Colaboratory. Therefore, only a web\nbrowser is needed to run Python scripts. Each week, Jupyter\nNotebook files are provided, and Python scripts can be executed\neasily by running cells on the notebook.\nPrerequisites for this course include following.\n- first-year undergraduate student level English,\n- first-year undergraduate student level mathematics,\n- first-year undergraduate student level physics,\n- a laptop computer,\n- experience of using web browswer (e.g. Firefox, Chrome) on a computer,\n- experience of keyboard typing on a computer,\nWe will have following sessions during the semester.\n“Executing a Python script“\n“Basic Python programming“\n“Importing and using Python modules“\n“Using Numpy for calculations“\n“Visualisation of data using Matplotlib“\n“Scientific calculations and analyses using SciPy“\n“Making and using relational database using Python“\n“Astronomical calculations using Astropy“\n“Blackbody radiation“\n“Distribution of asteroids, stars, and galaxies“\n“Hubble diagram and expansion of the Universe“\n“Estimating ages of star clusters“\n“Periodicity analysis of astronomical time-series data“\n“Source extraction and image alignment of astronomical images“\n“Planetary motion and orbital integration“\n“Stars/galaxies/asteroids classification“", "en": "The internet, the world-wide computer network, has revolutionised\nour society, and computer programming is getting more and more\nimportant for our life.
