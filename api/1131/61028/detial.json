A special coverage is considered on the application of GPS radio occultation (RO) data to typhoon prediction. The students should be able to understand the essential dynamics, mathematic formulations and some useful theories for the tropical cyclones and acquire some knowledge about RO data assimilation.\"", "en": "See above"}, "textbook": {"ch": "See right", "en": "\"1) Handbook- Tropical Cyclones (Y.
