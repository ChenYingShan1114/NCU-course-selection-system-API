The entry level machine shop works will also be practiced. In the second half of this semester, each group should complete the design, constructing, and testing of a novel analog/digital electronic system, by integrating the knowledges about the analog and digital systems previously learned. Two-wheel self-driving robots, electronic music instruments, and self-driving coin searcher are the few examples of the systems designed by previous students.\nThe third semester will be devoted to leaning the mechanical design and machine shop manipulation, and constructing an integrated physical system for exploring the assigned experimental subject. In the class, each group should give a forty minute oral report in English about the modern physics experimental systems and techniques, which are thoroughly self-studied by each group in the summer break before the semester. Each team should also design and construct their own driven double pendulum system, the electronic and imaging measurement systems, the data analysis software, and the software of the numerical simulation; and give a final oral report about their findings.\nStarting from the last few weeks of the third semester, each group has to start literature searches on modern physics topics published in the past five years on the prestige journals such as Nature, Science, Physical Review Letters, etc ; set a novel research topic, and design the experimental system for the special research topic to be conducted in the next semester.
