It contains a wide variety of analytical technologies such as linear programming (LP), nonlinear programming (NLP), integer programming (IP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and dynamic programming (DP).  Some of these technologies are being used in tasks such as factory scheduling, crew scheduling, supply chain management, production planning, petroleum refining, vehicle routing, and national defense on a daily basis, affecting the lives of hundreds of millions of people all over the world.  Therefore, chances are very good that after finishing the graduate program at NCU, you will encounter OR somewhere, some time in your professional career.  So it is crucial that you learn how to master these technologies as much as possible.\n\nThe objective of this course is to teach attending students graduate-level OR knowledge and how OR is being used in the real world.  One semester is barely enough for achieving such an objective.  Besides, attending students usually have different OR backgrounds.  Considering these and other factors, the instructor will cover topics which were carefully selected and can be comprehended by the majority of attending students.\nThere is a 2-hour lab session every week for this course.  It will teach basic computer programming skills and how to use them to solve OR problems (these are also practical skills for your industry career).  The topics covered in the lab session are\n1. Python (a programming language).\n2. Gurobi (a so-called \"solver,\" that is, optimization software) and how to use it from Python.\n3. Excel optimization.\nThere will be weekly homework and a midterm exam for the lab session, with the midterm exam being held directly in the computer lab.\nThere will be a project which counts for 30% of the total grade of this course.  To complete the project, 4 or 5 students will form a team and use Python and Gurobi to solve the assigned problem.  The project will be announced when the semester begins and due one week before the final exam (that is, it is semester-long).\nEnglish will be the main language used for this course; Mandarin will be used occasionally to facilitate communications.  Therefore, students are encouraged to pick up adequate English listening skills as soon as possible."}, "outline": {"ch": "參見右方", "en": "1. OR history\n2.
