The first period focused on the analysis of great philosopher’s concepts in order to create his own; the second period was marked by the completion and publication of his philosophical work Difference and Repetition, which has been considered as an outstanding oeuvre; the third period focused on the analysis of aesthetic elements of painting and cinema. These three periods are closely connected. Bergsonism to be read this semester belongs to the first period of Deleuze’s work, in which Deleuze analysed Bergson’s five concepts: Institution, Duration, Memory, Stimulation and Élan vital. The fruits of analysing Bergson’s concepts were also reflected in his later works, especially in his concepts of Difference and Image-Move-Time."}, "textbook": {"ch": "無", "en": "1.Henri Bergson Matière et mémoire, P.U.F, Paris, 1939.\n2.Henri Bergson Matter and Memory, translated by Nancy Margaret Paul and W.
