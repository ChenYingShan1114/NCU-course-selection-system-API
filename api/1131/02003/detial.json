It is historically divided into physical, biological, chemical, and geological oceanography. The basic goal of oceanography is to obtain a clear and systematic description of the oceans. It is hoped that an increased knowledge of the oceans will lead to a better understanding of how they control the climate of the earth and how they can be used as a source of food, chemicals, and energy. This course is concerned primarily with the physics and chemistry of the ocean. Descriptive oceanography approaches the ocean through both observations and complex numerical model output used to describe the fluid motions as quantitatively as possible. It is important to understand these descriptive features since the movement of ocean waters affects the biogeochemical processes that occur in the oceans.(This course is not limited to any academic background, welcome to undergraduate student)"}, "outline": {"ch": "Week 1 (2023/09/15) 課程介紹\nWeek 2 (2023/09/22) 海洋地形、海水物理特性\nWeek 3 (2023/09/29) 中秋節放假 (停課)\nWeek 4 (2023/10/06) 海水物理特性、海水的溫度和鹽度分佈\nWeek 5 (2023/10/13) 海水典型分布特徵、環流和水團\nWeek 6 (2023/10/20) 化學示踪劑在海洋學中的應用、海水主要成分的組成\nWeek 7 (2023/10/27) 大氣化學\nWeek 8 (2023/11/03) 期中作業 (不上課)\nWeek 9 (2023/11/10) 海洋中的微量營養\nWeek 10 (2023/11/17) 海洋數據分析概念和觀測方法、技術和儀器\nWeek 11 (2023/11/24) 海洋初級生產力\nWeek 12 (2023/12/01) 質量、鹽分和熱量收支和風力\nWeek 13 (2023/12/08) 太平洋\nWeek 14 (2023/12/15) 大西洋\nWeek 15 (2023/12/22) 印度洋\nWeek 16 (2023/12/29) 期末報告", "en": "Week 1 (2023/09/15) Curriculum＆ Instruction\nWeek 2 (2023/09/22) Ocean Dimensions, Shapes, and Bottom Materials / Physical Properties of Seawater\nWeek 3 (2023/09/29) Mid-Autumn Festival holiday (No class)\nWeek 4 (2023/10/06) Physical Properties of Seawater / Distribution of Temperature and Salinity for Ocean Waters\nWeek 5 (2023/10/13) Typical Distributions of Water Characteristics / Circulation and Water Masses of the Oceans\nWeek 6 (2023/10/20) Use of Chemical Tracers in Oceanography / Composition of the Major Components of Seawater\nWeek 7 (2023/10/27) Atmospheric Chemistry\nWeek 8 (2023/11/03) Mid-term Homework (No class)\nWeek 9 (2023/11/10) Micronutrients in the Oceans\nWeek 10 (2023/11/17) Data Analysis Concepts and Observational Methods / Technology and Instrumentation\nWeek 11 (2023/11/24) Primary Production in the Oceans\nWeek 12 (2023/12/01) Mass, Salt, and Heat Budgets and Wind Forcing\nWeek 13 (2023/12/08) Pacific Ocean\nWeek 14 (2023/12/15) Atlantic Ocean\nWeek 15 (2023/12/22) Indian Ocean\nWeek 16 (2023/12/29) Final-Report"}, "textbook": {"ch": "Chemical Oceanography 4th Edition By Frank J.
