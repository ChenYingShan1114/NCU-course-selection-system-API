As an interdisciplinary field of science, atmospheric chemistry has its main roots in meteorology and chemistry, with additional ties to microbiology, plant physiology, oceanography, and geology.  The extraordinarily rapid development of the field in the past three decades has added much new knowledge and insight into atmospheric processes and it has been regarded as a major focus in atmospheric science and environmental study, especially in the current issue - global change.\nThis introductory course is designed for the senior and above.  The purpose of this course is to give a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between chemical and atmospheric processes rather than to introduce the complicated chemical mechanisms.  This course is provided for broadening the scope of the students from the field of meteorology, and giving an understanding of the current environmental problems the globe concerns.\nThe contents of this course will be focused on the chemical and physical processes of the natural and anthropogenic products that interact with the atmosphere.  The practical issues including the acid rain, urban air pollution (e.g. photochemical smog), stratospheric ozone depletion, and global change, will be discussed.  The kinetic treatment of gaseous and aqueous chemistry will be introduced.  The aerosol chemistry will be also included.  The modeling of atmospheric chemistry and its linkage with atmospheric processes will be discussed.\nThe field of atmospheric chemistry would provide more opportunities of environmental research, and create more choices of future career for meteorological students.  After learning from this course, the students would be expected to have the basic knowledge to become a meteorological chemist or environmentalist.\""}, "outline": {"ch": "簡介\n基礎大氣物理回顧\n大氣化學動力與光化學回顧\n平流層化學\n對流層化學\n液相化學\n氣膠化學\n大氣化學模式\n全球變遷\n實驗", "en": "1.
