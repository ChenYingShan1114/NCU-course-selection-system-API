These initiatives share several common characteristics, such as promoting a spirit of self-initiative among residents and taking a bottom-up approach that respects local uniqueness. This is in contrast to the traditional \"top-down\" government-driven approach. They aim to shape local identity and gradually foster local culture by facilitating communication, coordination, and collaboration among community residents, thus stimulating local vitality and charm. However, it is important to consider whether the development measures at the community level, despite their ability to closely align with the needs of local residents and foster civic awareness, adequately emphasize a sense of local community identity. Furthermore, do the local sentiments and needs align with the focal points of urban and rural development, or do they each have their own distinct development logic?"}, "outline": {"ch": "導讀\n暖身---「大一生的三重挑戰」 摘自葉丙成臉書\n《非營利部門組織概論》第1章\n《非營利部門組織概論》第2章\n《非營利部門組織概論》第3章\n《非營利部門組織概論》第12章\n《非營利部門組織概論》第13章\n期中考\n《非營利部門組織概論》第14章\n《非營利部門組織概論》第5章\n《非營利部門組織概論》第6章\n《非營利部門組織概論》第7章\n期末考", "en": "Course Overview:\nIntroduction\nWarm-up - \"The Three Challenges of Freshmen\" from Yeh Bing-Cheng's Facebook\nChapter 1 of \"Introduction to Non-Profit Sector Organizations\"\nChapter 2 of \"Introduction to Non-Profit Sector Organizations\"\nChapter 3 of \"Introduction to Non-Profit Sector Organizations\"\nChapter 12 of \"Introduction to Non-Profit Sector Organizations\"\nChapter 13 of \"Introduction to Non-Profit Sector Organizations\"\nChapter 14 of \"Introduction to Non-Profit Sector Organizations\"\nChapter 5 of \"Introduction to Non-Profit Sector Organizations\"\nChapter 6 of \"Introduction to Non-Profit Sector Organizations\"\nChapter 7 of \"Introduction to Non-Profit Sector Organizations\"\nSelf-directed Learning\nSelf-directed Learning"}, "textbook": {"ch": "林淑馨，2019，《非營利組織概念》。高雄市：巨流。", "en": "as left"}, "selfCompiledRate": {"ch": "0", "en": "0"}, "instructMethod": {"ch": "講授\n\n\n\n其他", "en": ["Lecture", "", "", "", "Others"]}, "gradMethod": {"ch": "期中考期末考各50%", "en": "as left"}, "officeHour": {"ch": "周一下午1-3點", "en": "13.00-15.00 Monday"}, "teachWeeks": {"ch": "18", "en": "18"}, "flexDiscription": {"ch": "", "en": ""}, "domain": {"ch": "社會思潮領域", "en": "社會思潮領域"}, "map": {"ch": [{"competencies": "具備客家語言文化的基本能力", "rating": "(3)普通", "assesments": ["紙筆測驗/會考", "作業練習", "口頭報告/口試", "專題研究報告(書面)", "實作/實驗", "出席/課堂表現", "學習檔案評量", "自我評量/同儕互評", "作品/創作展演"]}, {"competencies": "具備社會科學的學科能力", "rating": "(4)高", "assesments": ["紙筆測驗/會考", "作業練習", "口頭報告/口試", "專題研究報告(書面)", "實作/實驗", "出席/課堂表現", "學習檔案評量", "自我評量/同儕互評", "作品/創作展演"]}, {"competencies": "具備人文關懷的精神", "rating": "(4)高", "assesments": ["紙筆測驗/會考", "作業練習", "口頭報告/口試", "專題研究報告(書面)", "實作/實驗", "出席/課堂表現", "學習檔案評量", "自我評量/同儕互評", "作品/創作展演"]}, {"competencies": "具備掌握時勢脈動與創新發展的視野", "rating": "(4)高", "assesments": ["紙筆測驗/會考", "作業練習", "口頭報告/口試", "專題研究報告(書面)", "實作/實驗", "出席/課堂表現", "學習檔案評量", "自我評量/同儕互評", "作品/創作展演"]}], "en": [{"competencies": "The basic ability of Hakka language and culture", "rating": "(3)Medium", "assesments": ["Test/Exam", "Assignments", "Presentation/Oral Exam", "Research Report(printed on paper)", "Practices/Experiments", "Attendance/Performance", "Portfolios Assessment", "Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment", "Products/Creative Performance"]}, {"competencies": "The academic ability of social sciences", "rating": "(4)High", "assesments": ["Test/Exam", "Assignments", "Presentation/Oral Exam", "Research Report(printed on paper)", "Practices/Experiments", "Attendance/Performance", "Portfolios Assessment", "Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment", "Products/Creative Performance"]}, {"competencies": "The spirit of humanity", "rating": "(4)High", "assesments": ["Test/Exam", "Assignments", "Presentation/Oral Exam", "Research Report(printed on paper)", "Practices/Experiments", "Attendance/Performance", "Portfolios Assessment", "Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment", "Products/Creative Performance"]}, {"competencies": "The perspectives to reflect times changes and to create new developmen", "rating": "(4)High", "assesments": ["Test/Exam", "Assignments", "Presentation/Oral Exam", "Research Report(printed on paper)", "Practices/Experiments", "Attendance/Performance", "Portfolios Assessment", "Self Assessment/ Peer Assessment", "Products/Creative Performance"]}]}, "assignCriteria": {"ch": ["系所:限客家語文暨社會科學學系。", "學制:限學士班。"], "en": ["Department:Department of Hakka Language and Social Sciences only.", "Type:Undergraduate Program only."]}, "preselecStu": 0, "stuGender": {"male": 0, "Female": 0}, "stuGrade": {"doctor": {}, "master": {}, "bachelor": {}}, "stus": []}
