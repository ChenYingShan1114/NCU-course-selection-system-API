It particularly emphasizes the probabilistic and statistical view to understand real problems that happen in our daily life. Through examples, homework, project, and exams, students can exercise their minds, clarify concepts and sophisticate their skills. It is expected that students are able to apply the underlying principles for solving real problems after this course.“"}, "outline": {"ch": "-", "en": "“Purposes of Course: The field of statistics deals with the collection, presentation, analysis, and use of data to make decisions and solve problems. Because many aspects of engineering practice involve working with data, obviously some knowledge of statistics is important to any engineer. Specifically, statistical techniques can be a powerful aid in designing new products and systems, improving existing designs, and designing, developing, and improving production processes. Statistical methods are used to help us describe and understand variability. By variability, we mean that successive observations of a system or phenomenon do not produce the same result. Statistical thinking can give us a useful way to incorporate this variability into our decision-making processes. Teaching Format:Lecture: 3 hours per week term project: 1-2 students group carry out a statistically relevant project approved by the lecturer. An oral presentation at the end of the semester.Midterm exams: 1-hour exam, twice a semester final: 2 hours examining Teaching Resources: LMS? for posting important announcements, assigned homework, solutions, lecture notes, reference materials, and other class relevant information.“"}, "textbook": {"ch": "-", "en": "“Engineering Statistics Douglas C.
