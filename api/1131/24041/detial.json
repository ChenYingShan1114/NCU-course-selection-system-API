In addition, external substances such as carcinogens, drugs, pollutants, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, and electromagnetic waves can also lead to the generation of free radicals. Emotional stress, such as anger or nervousness, can also produce free radicals. Free radicals can be generated by exposure to radiation, toxic chemicals, excessive sunlight, or through various metabolic processes, such as the breakdown of stored fats. In biological cells, free radicals can induce signal transduction, but excessive amounts can damage DNA, proteins, and lipids. This course aims to help students understand biomedical-related research and learn critical thinking and research methods.\n\nAs for the big data analysis course, this plan will be paired with the free online platform Datacamp (teaching program), allowing students to practice the skills learned in class at home through self-study. The platform enables real-time monitoring of student progress, and workshops outside of class hours are available for students to ask questions and assist with their research projects. The platform provides real-time feedback, significantly reducing the barriers to learning programming compared to traditional teaching methods, where students had to spend a lot of time finding answers on their own."}, "outline": {"ch": "1.
