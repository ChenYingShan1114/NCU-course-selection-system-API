Such ability is essential for experimental physics and also a foundation for innovation. To solve these two problems, this course will lead students to learn experimental physics in a self-exploratory way and cultivate students‘ ability to use modern electronic, optical, and mechanical techniques. It emphasizes hands-on construction and innovative design to build students‘ confidence in solving technical problems. Through a literature search, project proposal, experimental design, instrument construction, budget control, data analysis, progress report, and open exhibition, students are assisted by teaching assistants and receive comments from the instructor at each stage to acquire intensive technical training and build a comprehensive experience in project planning and execution. Since there is no fixed path to follow in this process, students will experience the challenge of self-learning, time management, teamwork, and decision-making risk, much like a leader in science and technology should be prepared for."}, "outline": {"ch": "資料查詢、計畫提案、實驗設計、儀器建造、進度和預算控制、數據分析、成果報告、公開展覽等系統化的流程", "en": "literature search, project proposal, experimental design, instrument construction,
