We will do this by using affect, a.k.a. emotion, as the main conceptual fulcrum to bring together all of the literary and cultural texts to be studied in this semester. In the first few weeks, we will cover some of the seminal texts in the field, with a strong emphasis on the Chinese studies segment. We’ll then specifically tackle our concern about affect by examining how emotions could be felt or represented quite differently in East and West. In the first unit of our foray into affect, we will discuss questions such as: “Does an individual exist in a communitarian culture like ours?”; or “How does our community affect our feelings and thoughts?” The next three units will attempt to answer these questions by each looking at a different type of emotion. Unit B employs Jin Yong’s martial arts novel to consider how tragic pathos could occur in a literary tradition without a generic equivalent to Greek or Renaissance tragedies and how such tragic pathos might in fact be mediated by two contradictory forces: a Westernized notion of the tragic hero and an ambivalent attachment to communitarian ideals such as filial piety and patriotism. Shifting the analytic lens from literary to filmic texts, Unit C focuses on how female bodies have been coded as sources of terror in both Hollywood and Japanese horror films, and how a certain communitarian rejection of individuated feelings might have played into the logic of a Japanese gothic work like Ju-on （《咒怨》）. In our last comparative exercise, we will seek to understand how depressive feelings could be transferred or lost in translation, as we map out a trajectory wherein writers such as Ha Jin and Eileen Chang whose native language is not English nevertheless end up using English to describe characters’ feelings in the Chinese context, as something inextricably bound up with their kinship or community ties.“", "en": "“In this introductory course, we’ll address key issues and concerns as well as recent developments in comparative literature.
