The main research areas to be discussed are typhoons, droughts, and floods. For typhoons, the course will cover environmental factors that contribute to the development of typhoons, as well as the vulnerability of different Asian regions to typhoon hazards. For droughts, the course will cover the use of satellite imagery and data assimilation for drought monitoring, and the assessment of drought vulnerability in different regions. For floods, the course will cover the use of satellite remote sensing, specifically synthetic aperture radar data, for flood monitoring and damage assessment. Finally, the use of remote sensing data for analysis of environmental issues such as eco-environmental vulnerability, urban greenspace, and urban heat island will also be briefly covered. Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to work on a project related to hydro-meteorological extremes. The techniques used for analysis in each of the main research areas will also be demonstrated for students to learn and apply in their own work. These include the use of satellite imagery such as optical, microwave, and radar, new remote sensing indices for surface water availability analysis, and machine learning and AI algorithms. The students will propose a research topic and later present their own results using the knowledge and techniques learned from the course.", "en": "This course covers topics of weather extremes and environmental issues, which includes typhoons, droughts, floods, eco-environmental vulnerability, urban greenspace, and urban heat island, and how these events can be assessed and monitored using remote sensing and artificial intelligence techniques.
