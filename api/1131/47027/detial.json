Today, the teaching of management upholds the idea of sustainability of business operation, the concept of SDG has becoming the centerpiece of business management. Nevertheless, the issue of labor or industrial relations has never been on the agenda of business management in Taiwan. Today, Taiwan’s business is confronting an ever greater challenge in global competition due to environment change in particular after the Covid-19. Geo-politics, trade competition, as well as regional wars have brought devastating effect on economic globalization, maintaining qualified and stable human resources is a must for business in today’s environment.  Thus, how the business and its employee can share common understanding regarding how business can be sustainable and able to face the challenge is a major concern.  The key pillar for business sustainability is its focus of employee/ labor relations. Through the teaching of contemporary theories of labor relations and practices, this course will assist students to get hold essential understandings of employee/labor relations and how business institutionalizes system and to resolve labor/employee issues. To establish a trust-based business culture is the major expectation of this course."}, "outline": {"ch": "本課程內容將包括勞資關系理論，並且進一步探討在勞資關係實作上，如何建立一個以信任為基礎的企業文化。包含勞資協商溝通、工會與員工參與制度、企業的社會責任、勞資爭議處理機制與制度、勞資參與之夥伴關係，企業之員工/勞資關係的策略選擇等。\n本課程將提供學習者對勞資關係與勞資協商之基本認識，瞭解影響勞資關係中之主要因素，以及雇主或管理者，員工及工會之角色扮演，認識員工關係/勞資關係與集體協商之概念和團體協約之管理。並且學習如何處理員工訴怨，面對勞資爭議以及熟悉勞資爭議處理之制度與程序等。平衡勞資關係之工具除了集體協商外，尚可包括勞工參與及社會對話等機制，以及企業內之策略性人力資源管理措施等。從人力資源管理之角度，當代勞資關系已經牽涉到更策略性層次的企業治理議題。一方面是供應鏈體系的企業社會責任之要求，一方面更是資本市場運作走向永續發展的企業治理目標 (ESG) 之認知，特別是在新冠疫情之全球肆虐後，員工與企業之間的連結歸屬性受到強大之考驗。企業開始認知到員工在工作與生活平衡上之需求，因此如何建立一個平衡的員工/勞資關係成為今日管理上的重大挑戰。\n本課程除分別探討相關思考框架，介紹相關制度，也會安排個案企業組織參訪，並且及請政府主管部門及專家進行專題講授，以融入實務面之分析。", "en": "This is a seminar course to offer a platform for students who are interested in and to explore the changing faces of contemporary employment and labor relations.

It is ever essential for business to uphold a qualitative and sustainable human resources to support business in a fast changing environment.
