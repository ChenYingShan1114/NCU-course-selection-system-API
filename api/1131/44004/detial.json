Economic and social conditions, such as the structure and changes in the product market, the trend of international trade, and changes in the population size and composition, affect the labor market and its outcome. While issues between employers and employees normally involve both monetary and non-monetary aspects. Understanding contemporary labor market issues before entering the market are important so as to enhance college students’ employability. This course is designed in response to the above mentioned needs. In this course, a balance will be maintained between the theoretical and empirical analysis. Some examples, mostly internationally and related to Taiwan, will be provided and discussed in class. The course thus aims to improve students' ability of economic analysis and critical thinking, and to achieve the goal of applying what they have learned in economics."}, "outline": {"ch": "1(09/13)Introduction\n2  (09/20)Overview of labor economics\n3  (09/27)Labor demand I --- firm’s decision and labor elasticity(1)\n4  (10/04)Labor demand I --- firm’s decision and labor elasticity(2)\n5  (10/11)Governmental labor policy 1--- minimum wage rate\n6  (10/18)Labor demand II --- standard work hours\n7  (10/25)Labor supply I --- an individual’s labor supply decision(1)\n9 8  (11/01)Labor supply I --- an individual’s labor supply decision(2)\n9  (11/08)Midterm examination\n10 (11/15)No class (Athletic Meet)\n11 (11/22)Governmental labor policy 2 --- guest workers and immigrants\n12  (11/29)Labor supply II --- time cost & money cost(1)\n13  (12/06)Labor supply II --- time cost & money cost(2)\n14  (12/13)Low birth rate and population aging in Taiwan and around the world\n15  (12/20)Employment-based pension in Taiwan\n16  (12/27)Final examination", "en": "1(09/13)Introduction\n2  (09/20)Overview of labor economics\n3  (09/27)Labor demand I --- firm’s decision and labor elasticity(1)\n4  (10/04)Labor demand I --- firm’s decision and labor elasticity(2)\n5  (10/11)Governmental labor policy 1--- minimum wage rate\n6  (10/18)Labor demand II --- standard work hours\n7  (10/25)Labor supply I --- an individual’s labor supply decision(1)\n9 8  (11/01)Labor supply I --- an individual’s labor supply decision(2)\n9  (11/08)Midterm examination\n10 (11/15)No class (Athletic Meet)\n11 (11/22)Governmental labor policy 2 --- guest workers and immigrants\n12  (11/29)Labor supply II --- time cost & money cost(1)\n13  (12/06)Labor supply II --- time cost & money cost(2)\n14  (12/13)Low birth rate and population aging in Taiwan and around the world\n15  (12/20)Employment-based pension in Taiwan\n16  (12/27)Final examination"}, "textbook": {"ch": "1.自行製作PPT講義\n2.
