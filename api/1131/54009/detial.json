This course will lead you to the use of Python to implement data science related applications. Python is an object-oriented, interpreted programming language that has been used extensively in the field of data science in recent years. This course is expected to lead students to use Python programs for data analysis and learning. This course is an implementation course that aims to deal with data processing from the perspective of educational data mining."}, "outline": {"ch": "1 Introduction\nWhat is Data Science?, Getting
