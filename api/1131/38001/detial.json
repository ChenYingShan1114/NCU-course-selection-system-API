The regular session time for the special topic seminar is every Tuesday from 15:00 to 16:50. For regular session schedules, please refer to the Mechanical Engineering Department website or the physical bulletin board announcement.\n(b) For non-regular sessions, students may choose to attend the following lectures marked as “Eligible for Special Topic Discussion“, such as:\nSpecial topic lectures organized by the Department of Mechanical Engineering (sign-in required).\nSpecial topic lectures organized by the Departments of Material Science, Optomechatronics, Energy, or other departments (requires approval and signature from the supervising professor on the reflection report).\nLaboratory safety and health training for new students and the subsequent reflection report (can add up to 2 extra points).\nOther types of lectures (such as seminars), subject to approval by the supervising professor and the course instructor.\nOther: Other situations will be announced and handled by the course instructor as per the circumstances, such as pandemics, natural disasters, or other immediate crises.\nCourse Regulations:\nFor regular sessions, please sit according to the seating chart in the classroom. Teaching assistants will take attendance by taking photos 10 minutes after the class starts, and random checks/photos may be taken during the class. This course prohibits lateness and leaving early. Without a special reason, being more than 10 minutes late will be counted as an absence.\nFor non-regular sessions, please sign in personally at the entrance of the lecture venue. The teaching assistants will use the sign-in sheet for attendance.\nDuring the class, students must listen attentively to the oral reports and write a one-page (A4) reflection report on the spot, and submit the electronic file of the reflection report to the course assignment section “on the day of the lecture“. The report should include the lecture topic, the name of the speaker, a summary of the lecture content, personal reflections, and questions asked."}, "textbook": {"ch": "由專家學者提供資料。", "en": "Materials provided by the expert scholars giving the lectures."}, "selfCompiledRate": {"ch": "0", "en": "0"}, "instructMethod": {"ch": "研討", "en": ["Seminar"]}, "gradMethod": {"ch": "1. 按上述規定出席次數，心得單內容亦合格者，則有基本分數78分。多出席一次，總分加3分，但總分最高為95分。出席/繳交比例未達規定者，以出席/繳交比例計分。缺席三次以上直接死當或心得單內容明顯不佳，或與主題偏離者，以不及格論。\n2. 為鼓勵同學踴躍發言，如於課堂上提出問題者，一次加總分2分，總分最高為95分（表現特別優異者可超過95分）。請有發問的同學，演講後當天請向助教登記，以利加分作業。若當天未告知，視同放棄。\n3. 演講中途若有緊急事項須離席者，應向主持老師(或負責之助教)報告後才可離席，其出席之認定由任課老師視其情況處理之；若助教隨機抽點(拍照)發現有簽到而未在場者，當次以未出席論，同時扣總分20 分。\n4. 為了尊重演講者及維持秩序，於聽講中不可喧嘩、使用手機、睡覺、飲食等行為。本學期中累計2次(含)以上者，以不及格論。\n5. 對成績有疑慮者，請與助教確認。學期成績公告三天後，不受理任何異議。", "en": "According to the aforementioned attendance rules, if the reflection reports are also qualified, a base score of 78 points is awarded. For each additional attendance, 3 points are added, with a maximum total of 95 points. The content of the reflection reports is also considered in the instructor‘s grading. If the attendance/submission ratio does not meet the requirements, scoring will be based on this ratio. Direct failure in the course or a noticeably poor quality of reflection reports will result from missing more than three sessions.\nTo encourage active participation, asking questions during the class will add 2 points each time, with a maximum total of 95 points (exceptionally outstanding performance may exceed 95 points). Students who ask questions should register with the teaching assistant on the day of the lecture for the extra points. Failure to notify on the same day will be considered a forfeiture of the points.\nIf you need to leave the lecture due to an emergency, you must report to the presiding teacher (or responsible teaching assistant) before leaving. The instructor will decide whether to consider it as attendance based on the situation. If the teaching assistant finds someone absent during a random check (photo) despite having signed in, that session will be counted as an absence and 20 points will be deducted from the total score.\nTo respect the speaker and maintain order, disruptive behaviors such as making noise, using mobile phones, sleeping, or eating during the lecture are not allowed. Accumulating such behaviors more than twice (inclusive) in a semester will result in a failing grade.\nIf there are concerns about the grades, please confirm with the teaching assistant.
