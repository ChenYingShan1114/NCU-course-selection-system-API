Putting this material together will help us in reading and asking questions of feminist fictional and theoretical narratives. We will read fictions that theorize and theories that tell a story about women’s problems and empowerment, with varying emphases, turning points and catalysts, toward transformation of conditions that structurally enable multiple inequalities.
