We will read three sets of texts that are embedded in historical events. The first is the naming of a “high feminism” in English literature nearly fifty years ago – in Jane Eyre, at a moment of the emergence of postcolonial feminist readings and feminism as “high” academic subject in 1980s USA. The second set of texts is from the two decades crossing over into the 21st century in South Korea, in the wake of the Asian economic crisis at the turn of the century. We will read earlier theorizations of the concept and phenomenon of “housewifization,” and follow this with anthropological and fictional works translated from South Korean that together complicate while responding to the former in a way that reveal a cold war partition of knowledge production. Finally, we will consider a recent new edition of an old classic alongside online animée, an earlier documentary, and a contemporary tv series from Taiwan that can be read as counter-discourses to feminist and dual sphere formations studied in sections one and two. Required fiction include: Jane Eyre (Charlotte Brönte), Wide Sargasso Sea (Jean Rhys), Kim Ji-young, Born 1982 (Cho Nam-joo), The Kreutzer Sonata (Tolstoy). For those interested in taking the course, please read Jane Eyre, and if possible, Wide Sargasso Sea, before the semester begins in September. These are available via ee-class online and through Gaoguan (Snack Alley).", "en": "This course is an introduction to how feminist and feminism are composed through stories that mean, as well as the means whereby these are transmitted and matter, in worlds not entirely encompassed by nor translatable into English-es.
