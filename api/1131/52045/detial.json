We will discuss their origins, applications, merits, as well as demerits from the viewpoint of functionality and code modularity. Some relevant design patterns will also be mentioned and compared. Since these topics are hardly mentioned in existing textbooks, we will use our slides as the teaching materials. This year we will have many exercises for you to program in the classroom, so you will need to bring your laptop in these weeks."}, "textbook": {"ch": "無", "en": "n/a"}, "selfCompiledRate": {"ch": "100", "en": "100"}, "instructMethod": {"ch": "", "en": [""]}, "gradMethod": {"ch": "出席30%、隨堂練習40%、期末專題30%", "en": "Attendance 30%, Exercise 40%, Final Project 30%"}, "officeHour": {"ch": "另行約定", "en": "by appointment"}, "teachWeeks": {"ch": "16+2", "en": "16+2"}, "flexDiscription": {"ch": "留予課程總複習QA、期末專題實作輔導", "en": "The last two weeks are for project Implementation and Q&A."}, "domain": {"ch": "人工智慧、資料科學與多媒體研究群", "en": "人工智慧、資料科學與多媒體研究群"}, "map": {"ch": [], "en": []}, "assignCriteria": {"ch": ["系所:限資訊工程學系碩士班、資訊工程學系軟體工程碩士班、資訊工程學系AI碩士班、資訊工程學系博士班。", "系所:限資訊工程學系。年級:限三年級、四年級。", "系所:限人工智慧國際碩士學位學程。"], "en": ["Department:MSc in Computer Science and Information Engineering、Institute of Software Engineering、Master‘s Program in Artificial Intelligence, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering、PhD in Computer Science and Information Engineering only.", "Department:Department of Computer Science and Elec.
