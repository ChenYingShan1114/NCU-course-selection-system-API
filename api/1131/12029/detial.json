We will read studies of speculative fiction by Aimee Bahng, Dean Spade, Curtis Marez, and others that consider gender and sexuality in relation to neoliberal racial capitalism, immigration/migration, and labor histories.\nThere will be weekly reading responses, sometimes on an assigned topic, and a 10-page final paper also on the assigned readings. Each student will be responsible for at least one oral presentation. Regular attendance and participation in seminar discussions are required.\nThe weekly response is a short (1-2 pages) analysis of the treatment or representation of a relevant issue in the assigned text. Sometimes the issue will be assigned with the reading for the week. The response should never be a general description of the text, but your own focused engagement with it. I want to see how you read the text, bringing your own knowledge to bear on it while also making use of the material introduced and discussed in class.\nThe presentations on theoretical texts will present the main thesis and argument and place this within the concerns of the seminar by reading key passages and explicating them, making connections to related issues in other texts we have covered, and bringing up thoughtful questions for the class to discuss. Presentations on cultural texts should provide an analysis of the text by engaging the theoretical frameworks from previous readings. The task is not to apply the theory to the literature but to see how the literary and theoretical texts can be made to speak to each other, and what useful insights might emerge from their combination. Presentations should take approximately 40-50 minutes (or the first hour of the seminar, not including discussion of the questions).\nPapers:  The final paper topics will be proposed by students, preferably drawing on the work they have done in the weekly responses. Papers should show what students have learned over the course of the seminar, and their own thinking on the materials.\"", "en": "\"Over the past decade and on a transnational scale, speculative fiction, especially science fiction, fantasy, and weird fiction, has been become an important resource for both critiquing and thinking outside of the constraints of politically realist logics.
