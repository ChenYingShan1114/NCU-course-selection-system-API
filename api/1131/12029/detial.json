Presentations on cultural texts should provide an analysis of the text by engaging the theoretical frameworks from previous readings. The task is not to apply the theory to the literature but to see how the literary and theoretical texts can be made to speak to each other, and what useful insights might emerge from their combination. Presentations should take approximately 40-50 minutes (or the first hour of the seminar, not including discussion of the questions).\nPapers:  The final paper topics will be proposed by students.
