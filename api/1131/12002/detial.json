We will form an online audio-video channel, produce short pieces for it, and learn to critique each others‘ works. Each student is expected to participate in at least two short video and sound production exercises. By the end of this course, you will be 1. more aware of the role of writing in media and media in writing; 2. able to understand and appropriate English-language media materials; 3. able to develop self-learning and peer-learning skills. Participation in all classes and time management skills are required. You are encouraged to reflect on your learning experiences in a weekly journal.
