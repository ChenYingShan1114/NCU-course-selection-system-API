To use the knowledge of remote sensing that you make the world a better place. Remote sensing technology has proven to provide numerous scientific, commercial, and social benefits. Among these is not only the efficiency it brings to the day‐to‐day decision‐making process in an ever‐increasing range of applications, but also the potential this field holds for improving the stewardship of earth’s resources and the global environment.(This course is not limited to any academic background, welcome to undergraduate student)"}, "outline": {"ch": "Week 1 (2024/09/10) 課程介紹\nWeek 2 (2024/09/17) 中秋節 (停課)\nWeek 3 (2024/09/24) 遙感探測的概念和基礎 I\nWeek 4 (2024/10/01) 遙感探測的概念和基礎 II\nWeek 5 (2024/10/08) 多光譜、熱紅外和高光譜遙測 I\nWeek 6 (2024/10/15) 多光譜、熱紅外和高光譜遙測 II\nWeek 7 (2024/10/22) 地球資源衛星 I\nWeek 8 (2024/10/29) 地球資源衛星 II\nWeek 9 (2024/11/05) 期中作業 (不上課)\nWeek 10 (2024/11/12) 地球資源衛星 III\nWeek 11 (2024/11/19) 微波和激光雷達遙測 I\nWeek 12 (2024/11/26) 微波和激光雷達遙測 II\nWeek 13 (2024/12/03) 遙測應用 I\nWeek 14 (2024/12/10) 遙測應用 II\nWeek 15 (2024/12/17) 海洋遙測\nWeek 16 (2024/12/24) Final-Report", "en": "Week 1 (2024/09/10) Curriculum＆ Instruction\nWeek 2 (2024/09/17) Mid-Autumn Festival (No class)\nWeek 3 (2024/09/24) Concepts and Foundations of Remote Sensing I\nWeek 4 (2024/10/01) Concepts and Foundations of Remote Sensing II\nWeek 5 (2024/10/08)  Multispectral, Thermal, and Hyperspectral Sensing I\nWeek 6 (2024/10/15) Multispectral, Thermal, and Hyperspectral Sensing II\nWeek 7 (2024/10/22) Earth Resource Satellites Operating in the Optical Spectrum I\nWeek 8 (2024/10/29) Earth Resource Satellites Operating in the Optical Spectrum II\nWeek 9 (2024/11/05) Mid-term Homework (No class)\nWeek 10 (2024/11/12) Earth Resource Satellites Operating in the Optical Spectrum III\nWeek 11 (2024/11/19) Microwave and Lidar Sensing I\nWeek 12 (2024/11/26) Microwave and Lidar Sensing II\nWeek 13 (2024/12/03) Applications of Remote Sensing I\nWeek 14 (2024/12/10) Applications of Remote Sensing II\nWeek 15 (2024/12/17) Ocean Remote Sensing\nWeek 16 (2024/12/24) Final-Report"}, "textbook": {"ch": "Descriptive Physical Oceanography 6th Edition By Lynne TalleyIntroduction to satellite oceanography by G.
