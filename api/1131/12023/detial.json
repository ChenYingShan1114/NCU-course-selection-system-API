It is a form of feature writing. We will begin by reading sample profiles and practicing the types of writing techniques involved, such as describing people and places, narrating events, and presenting a theme. Early in the semester, students will submit a list of possible topics to be approved by the instructor. After the topics are chosen, students will learn how to conduct library and internet research, do fieldwork (observing, interviewing, sometimes participating), and organize and analyze data. The final weeks will consist of self and peer evaluation activities in writing workshops on the first and second drafts. The final profile will be turned in with all drafts and relevant materials, including brainstorming activities, preliminary writing assignments, observation and interview notes, outlines, written peer evaluations, etc., so you must save all your prewriting material.", "en": "A profile is a type of reportage that presents a vivid, insightful portrait of a person, place or event.
