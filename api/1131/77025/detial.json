Among the questions that we will ask are: Is the natural world intrinsically valuable? If so, are businesses obligated to take this value into account when deciding whether to adopt potentially environmentally destructive practices? What are the implications of libertarian, free-market moral principles for the ethics of pollution-causing business activities? How should we understand the basis of our obligations to preserve the environment for future generations, and what are the implications for the practice of business? Are businesses that have contributed significantly to the threat of ecosystem (e.g. oil companies) obligated to contribute to environmental protection? More and more people believe that business leaders may be in the pursuit of profit but also lead the moral, to participate in the protection of future generations of the environment. Therefore, environmental responsibility can be an important strategy for enterprises to protect the environment not only to obtain the trust of consumers, employees and the community, but also get the respect of the national government.\""}, "outline": {"ch": "\" 什麼是企業倫理?\n 什麼是環境倫理?\n 企業的環境影響\n 企業對員工的倫理義務\n 企業對社區的倫理義務\n 企業與消費主義\n 企業對動物的倫理義務\n 企業對自然生態的倫理義務\n 企業的環境社會責任\"", "en": "\"What is business ethics?\nWhat is environmental ethics?\nThe environmental impact of business\nThe obligation of the corporation to employee\nThe obligation of the corporation to community\nThe corporation and consumerism\nThe obligation of the corporation to future generation\nThe obligation of the corporation to animals\nThe obligation of the corporation to ecosystem\nCSR and environmental responsibility\""}, "textbook": {"ch": "\"葉保強著，《企業倫理》，五南，2008。\n雅克‧蒂洛等著，《倫理學與生活》。世界圖書出版公司，2008。\"", "en": "\"葉保強著，《企業倫理》，五南，2008。\n雅克‧蒂洛等著，《倫理學與生活》。世界圖書出版公司，2008。\nPeter Singer, Practical Ethics, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993.\""}, "selfCompiledRate": {"ch": "80", "en": "80"}, "instructMethod": {"ch": "講授\n研討", "en": ["Lecture", "Seminar"]}, "gradMethod": {"ch": "1.課堂參與、學習單20% ; 2.課堂報告20%； 3.期中考30% 4.期末考30%。", "en": "\"Attendance and discussion 20%\nOral presentation 20%\nMid-term exam 30%\nFinal exam 30%\""}, "officeHour": {"ch": "週一上午8-10點", "en": "Monday 8-10AM"}, "teachWeeks": {"ch": "16+2", "en": "16+2"}, "flexDiscription": {"ch": "搭配課程設計，17、18兩週引導同學自行製作綠色生活筆記。", "en": "With course design, guide students to make green life notes by themselves in the last 2 weeks"}, "domain": {"ch": "社會思潮領域", "en": "社會思潮領域"}, "map": {"ch": [{"competencies": "具備客家語言文化的基本能力", "rating": "(0)無", "assesments": ["無"]}, {"competencies": "具備社會科學的學科能力", "rating": "(5)非常高", "assesments": ["紙筆測驗/會考", "口頭報告/口試", "專題研究報告(書面)", "出席/課堂表現"]}, {"competencies": "具備人文關懷的精神", "rating": "(5)非常高", "assesments": ["紙筆測驗/會考", "口頭報告/口試", "專題研究報告(書面)", "出席/課堂表現"]}, {"competencies": "具備掌握時勢脈動與創新發展的視野", "rating": "(5)非常高", "assesments": ["紙筆測驗/會考", "口頭報告/口試", "專題研究報告(書面)", "出席/課堂表現"]}], "en": [{"competencies": "The basic ability of Hakka language and culture", "rating": "(0)", "assesments": ["No assessment"]}, {"competencies": "The academic ability of social sciences", "rating": "(5)VeryHigh", "assesments": ["Test/Exam", "Presentation/Oral Exam", "Research Report(printed on paper)", "Attendance/Performance"]}, {"competencies": "The spirit of humanity", "rating": "(5)VeryHigh", "assesments": ["Test/Exam", "Presentation/Oral Exam", "Research Report(printed on paper)", "Attendance/Performance"]}, {"competencies": "The perspectives to reflect times changes and to create new developmen", "rating": "(5)VeryHigh", "assesments": ["Test/Exam", "Presentation/Oral Exam", "Research Report(printed on paper)", "Attendance/Performance"]}]}, "assignCriteria": {"ch": ["系所:限客家語文暨社會科學學系。", "學制:限學士班。"], "en": ["Department:Department of Hakka Language and Social Sciences only.", "Type:Undergraduate Program only."]}, "preselecStu": 0, "stuGender": {"male": 0, "Female": 0}, "stuGrade": {"doctor": {}, "master": {}, "bachelor": {}}, "stus": []}
