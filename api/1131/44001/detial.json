Our goal is to help students understand the motivation of individual economic agents – person, household, firm or government – and how they interact in various market structures. We address these questions through stories, graphs, and mathematical models. Mathematics allows us to build much more precise models and to master the most important core components. But more importantly, we want our student to be able to impart economic meaning and conclusions to the equations, derivatives and graphs.\"", "en": "\"Economics is the social science of choices, and the primary objective of this course is to introduce students to the way that economists build mathematical models to understand these choices.
