In the first, assignments are textbook readings on structure and research methodology for academic essays in humanities, and we will discuss these assignments by analyzing sample student papers. Each week, students will be asked to write a short analysis of the structure and argumentation of a sample paper according to its use of one or more of the techniques introduced in the textbooks. During the second part of the course, our meetings will be conducted as workshop seminars also led by the students.\nThe choice of paper for the workshop is basically a paper from a previous class (approximately 10 pages long and incorporating some secondary\nsources). If you don‘t already have a paper that meets all these requirements, you should write one during the first few weeks of class."}, "textbook": {"ch": "自編教材", "en": "A reader will be provided"}, "selfCompiledRate": {"ch": "100%", "en": "100%"}, "instructMethod": {"ch": "講授\n研討\n\n個別指導\n其他", "en": ["Lecture", "Seminar", "", "Individual Instruction", "Others"]}, "gradMethod": {"ch": "1. 每週作業與工作坊表演: 30％\n2. 書目注釋: 20％\n3. 改寫的期末報告: 50％\n (請注意，過多缺席與抄襲很可能會造成無法通過本課程)", "en": "1.
